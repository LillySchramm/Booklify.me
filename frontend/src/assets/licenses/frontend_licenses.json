Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

The script is shipped as a separate package. Run the following command to install it:\n\n```sh\nnpm i --save-dev @ngneat/until-destroy-migration\n# Or if you use yarn\nyarn add -D @ngneat/until-destroy-migration\n```\n\nThen run the following command:\n\n```shell script\nnpx @ngneat/until-destroy-migration --base my/path\n```\n\n`base` defaults to `./src/app`.\n\nYou can use the `--removeOnDestroy` flag for empty `OnDestroy` methods removing.\n\n```shell script\nnpx @ngneat/until-destroy-migration --removeOnDestroy\n```\n\nYou can remove the package once the migration is done.\n\n## Potential Pitfalls\n\n- The order of decorators is important, make sure to put `@UntilDestroy()` before the `@Component()` decorator.\n- When using [`overrideComponent`](https://angular.io/api/core/testing/TestBed#overrideComponent) in unit tests remember that it overrides metadata and component definition. Invoke `UntilDestroy()(YourComponent);` to reapply the decorator. See [here](https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy/issues/91#issuecomment-626470446) for an example.\n\n## ESLint Rules\n\n- [prefer-takeuntil](https://github.com/cartant/eslint-plugin-rxjs-angular/blob/main/docs/rules/prefer-takeuntil.md#options)\n- [no-unsafe-takeuntil](https://github.com/cartant/eslint-plugin-rxjs/blob/main/docs/rules/no-unsafe-takeuntil.md#options)\n\n## Contributors ✨\n\nThanks goes to these wonderful people ([emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key)):\n\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:START - Do not remove or modify this section -->\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n<!-- markdownlint-disable -->\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://www.netbasal.com\"><img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6745730?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Netanel Basal</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy/commits?author=NetanelBasal\" title=\"Code\">💻</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy/commits?author=NetanelBasal\" title=\"Documentation\">📖</a> <a href=\"#ideas-NetanelBasal\" title=\"Ideas, Planning, & Feedback\">🤔</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/@overthesanity\"><img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7337691?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Artur Androsovych</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy/commits?author=arturovt\" title=\"Code\">💻</a> <a href=\"#example-arturovt\" title=\"Examples\">💡</a> <a href=\"#ideas-arturovt\" title=\"Ideas, Planning, & Feedback\">🤔</a> <a href=\"#infra-arturovt\" title=\"Infrastructure (Hosting, Build-Tools, etc)\">🚇</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/KrzysztofKarol\"><img src=\"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/12470911?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Krzysztof Karol</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"#content-KrzysztofKarol\" title=\"Content\">🖋</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/gund\"><img src=\"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3644678?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Alex Malkevich</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy/commits?author=gund\" title=\"Code\">💻</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/webdevius\"><img src=\"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2960769?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Khaled Shaaban</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy/commits?author=webdevius\" title=\"Code\">💻</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/kmathy\"><img src=\"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15690980?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>kmathy</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy/commits?author=kmathy\" title=\"Code\">💻</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/FFKL\"><img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11336491?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Dmitrii Korostelev</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy/commits?author=FFKL\" title=\"Code\">💻</a></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<!-- markdownlint-enable -->\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:END -->\n\nThis project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) specification.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\nthe various releases.\n\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.

This is typically the case when an 979-prefix ISBN-13 was converted to an ISBN-10 (which is wrong as 979-prefixed ISBNs can't have ISBN-10), and then re-converted to an ISBN-13 with the 978 prefix.

Unfortunately, those groups aren't fixed once for all, and we need to update those data periodically.\n\nOnce a month, a [CI job](https://github.com/inventaire/isbn3/blob/main/.github/workflows/auto_update_groups_data.yml) takes care of updating ISBN groups data and publishing a patch version:\n![Auto-update groups data](https://github.com/inventaire/isbn3/workflows/Update%20groups%20and%20publish/badge.svg)\n\nTo get the latest data, you thus just need to update to the latest version (beware of [breaking changes](https://github.com/inventaire/isbn3/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) if that makes you switch to a new major version though):\n\n```sh\nnpm install isbn3@latest\n```\n\n## See also\n* [isbn-groups](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isbn-groups): infer a language from an ISBN group",

Import the `TimeagoModule`:\n\nOnce installed you need to import the main module into your application module by calling TimeagoModule.forRoot().\n\nMake sure you only call this method in the root module of your application, most of the time called `AppModule`.\nThis method allows you to configure the `TimeagoModule` by specifying a formatter, clock and/or an intl service. You should end up with code similar to this:\n\n```ts\nimport { BrowserModule } from \"@angular/platform-browser\";\nimport { NgModule } from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { TimeagoModule } from \"ngx-timeago\";\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [BrowserModule, TimeagoModule.forRoot()],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}\n```\n\n##### SharedModule\n\nIf you use a [`SharedModule`](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/ngmodule.html#!#shared-modules) that you import in multiple other feature modules,\nyou can export the `TimeagoModule` to make sure you don't have to import it in every module.\n\n```ts\n@NgModule({\n  exports: [CommonModule, TimeagoModule],\n})\nexport class SharedModule {}\n```\n\n##### Lazy loaded modules\n\nWhen you lazy load a module, you should use the `forChild` static method to import the `TimeagoModule`.\n\nSince lazy loaded modules use a different injector from the rest of your application, you can configure them separately with a different formatter/clock/intl service.\n\n```ts\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    TimeagoModule.forChild({\n      formatter: { provide: TimeagoFormatter, useClass: CustomFormatter },\n      clock: { provide: TimeagoClock, useClass: CustomClock },\n      intl: { provide: TimeagoIntl, useClass: CustomIntl },\n    }),\n  ],\n})\nexport class LazyLoadedModule {}\n```\n\n##### I18n\n\nBy default, there is no intl service available, as the default formatter doesn't provide language support.\nYou should provide one, if you end up with a formatter that needs it (either TimeagoCustomFormatter which is provided by the lib or your own). The purpose of the intl service is to contain all the necessary i18n strings used by your formatter.\n\n```ts\nimport { NgModule } from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { BrowserModule } from \"@angular/platform-browser\";\nimport { Timeago, TimeagoIntl, TimeagoFormatter, TimeagoCustomFormatter } from \"ngx-timeago\";\nimport { AppComponent } from \"./app\";\n\nexport class MyIntl extends TimeagoIntl {\n  // do extra stuff here...\n}\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    TimeagoModule.forRoot({\n      intl: { provide: TimeagoIntl, useClass: MyIntl },\n      formatter: { provide: TimeagoFormatter, useClass: TimeagoCustomFormatter },\n    }),\n  ],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}\n```\n\nThere is support for a large number of languages out of the box. This support is based on the string objects taken from `jquery-timeago`.\n\nTo use any of the languages provided, you will have to import the language strings and feed them to the intl service.\n\n```ts\nimport { Component } from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { TimeagoIntl } from \"ngx-timeago\";\nimport { strings as englishStrings } from \"ngx-timeago/language-strings/en\";\n\n@Component({\n  selector: \"app\",\n  template: ` <div timeago [date]=\"1553683912689\"></div> `,\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  constructor(intl: TimeagoIntl) {\n    intl.strings = englishStrings;\n    intl.changes.next();\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can also customize the language strings or provide your own.\n\n#### 2. Use the pipe or the directive:\n\nThis is how you do it with the **pipe**:\n\n```html\n<div>{{1553683912689 | timeago:live}}</div>\n```\n\nAnd in your component define live (`true` by default).\n\nThis is how you use the **directive**:\n\n```html\n<div timeago [date]=\"1553683912689\" [live]=\"live\"></div>\n```\n\n## API\n\n#### Write your own formatter\n\nIf you want to write your own formatter, you need to create a class that implements `TimeagoFormatter`. The only required method is `format` that must return the final `string`.\n\n[Example](lib/src/timeago.formatter.ts)\n\nOnce you've defined your formatter, you can provide it in your configuration.\n\n```ts\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    TimeagoModule.forRoot({\n      formatter: { provide: TimeagoFormatter, useClass: CustomFormatter },\n    }),\n  ],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}\n```\n\n#### Write your own clock\n\nThe only required method to build your own clock, is `tick` that must return an `Observable<any>`. Whenever this observable emits, the timestamp will be updated, using your formatter (and intl, if available).\n\n```ts\nimport { TimeagoClock } from \"ngx-timeago\";\nimport { Observable, interval } from \"rxjs\";\n\n// ticks every 2s\nexport class MyClock extends TimeagoClock {\n  tick(then: number): Observable<number> {\n    return interval(2000);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSetup the clock in your module import by adding it to the `forRoot` (or `forChild`) configuration.\n\n```ts\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    TimeagoModule.forRoot({\n      clock: { provide: TimeagoClock, useClass: MyClock },\n    }),\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}\n```\n\n## Contribute\n\n`ngx-timeago` is packaged with [ng-packagr](https://github.com/dherges/ng-packagr) and then imported into an Angular CLI app.\nTo run the demo, do the following steps:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install\n$ npm run build:lib\n$ npm start\n```\n\n---\n\nMIT © [Vasilis Diakomanolis](https://github.com/ihym)",

This includes files in which no replacements were made.\n\nEach result contains the following values:\n\n- `file`: The path to the file that was processed\n- `hasChanged`: Flag to indicate if the file was changed or not\n\n```js\nconst results = replace.sync({\n  files: 'path/to/files/*.html',\n  from: /foo/g,\n  to: 'bar',\n});\n\nconsole.log(results);\n\n// [\n//   {\n//     file: 'path/to/files/file1.html',\n//     hasChanged: true,\n//   },\n//   {\n//     file: 'path/to/files/file2.html',\n//     hasChanged: true,\n//   },\n//   {\n//     file: 'path/to/files/file3.html',\n//     hasChanged: false,\n//   },\n// ]\n\n```\n\nTo get an array of changed files, simply map the results as follows:\n\n```js\nconst changedFiles = results\n  .filter(result => result.hasChanged)\n  .map(result => result.file);\n```\n\n### Counting matches and replacements\nBy setting the `countMatches` configuration flag to `true`, the number of matches and replacements per file will be counted and present in the results array.\n\n- `numMatches`: Indicates the number of times a match was found in the file\n- `numReplacements`: Indicates the number of times a replacement was made in the file\n\nNote that the number of matches can be higher than the number of replacements if a match and replacement are the same string.\n\n```js\nconst results = replace.sync({\n  files: 'path/to/files/*.html',\n  from: /foo/g,\n  to: 'bar',\n  countMatches: true,\n});\n\nconsole.log(results);\n\n// [\n//   {\n//     file: 'path/to/files/file1.html',\n//     hasChanged: true,\n//     numMatches: 3,\n//     numReplacements: 3,\n//   },\n//   {\n//     file: 'path/to/files/file2.html',\n//     hasChanged: true,\n//     numMatches: 1,\n//     numReplacements: 1,\n//   },\n//   {\n//     file: 'path/to/files/file3.html',\n//     hasChanged: false,\n//     numMatches: 0,\n//     numReplacements: 0,\n//   },\n// ]\n```\n\n### Custom processor\n\nFor advanced usage where complex processing is needed it's possible to use a callback that will receive content as an argument and should return it processed.\n\n```js\nconst results = replace.sync({\n  files: 'path/to/files/*.html',\n  processor: (input) => input.replace(/foo/g, 'bar'),\n});\n```\n\n### Array of custom processors\n\nPassing processor function also supports passing an array of functions that will be executed sequentially\n\n```js\nfunction someProcessingA(input) {\n  const chapters = input.split('###')\n  chapters[1] = chapters[1].replace(/foo/g, 'bar')\n  return chapters.join('###')\n}\n\nfunction someProcessingB(input) {\n  return input.replace(/foo/g, 'bar')\n}\n\nconst results = replace.sync({\n  files: 'path/to/files/*.html',\n  processor: [someProcessingA, someProcessingB],\n});\n```\n\n## Advanced usage\n\n### Replace a single file or glob\n```js\nconst options = {\n  files: 'path/to/file',\n};\n```\n\n### Replace multiple files or globs\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  files: [\n    'path/to/file',\n    'path/to/other/file',\n    'path/to/files/*.html',\n    'another/**/*.path',\n  ],\n};\n```\n\n### Replace first occurrence only\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  from: 'foo',\n  to: 'bar',\n};\n```\n\n### Replace all occurrences\nPlease note that the value specified in the `from` parameter is passed straight to the native [String replace method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace). As such, if you pass a string as the `from` parameter, it will _only replace the first occurrence_.\n\nTo replace multiple occurrences at once, you must use a regular expression for the `from` parameter with the global flag enabled, e.g. `/foo/g`.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  from: /foo/g,\n  to: 'bar',\n};\n```\n\n### Multiple values with the same replacement\n\nThese will be replaced sequentially.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  from: [/foo/g, /baz/g],\n  to: 'bar',\n};\n```\n\n### Multiple values with different replacements\n\nThese will be replaced sequentially.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  from: [/foo/g, /baz/g],\n  to: ['bar', 'bax'],\n};\n```\n\n### Custom regular expressions\n\nUse the [RegExp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp) constructor to create any regular expression.\n\n```js\nconst str = 'foo';\nconst regex = new RegExp('^' + str + 'bar', 'i');\nconst options = {\n  from: regex,\n  to: 'bar',\n};\n```\n\n### Using callbacks for `from`\nYou can also specify a callback that returns a string or a regular expression. The callback receives the name of the file in which the replacement is being performed, thereby allowing the user to tailor the search string. The following example uses a callback to produce a search string dependent on the filename:\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  files: 'path/to/file',\n  from: (file) => new RegExp(file, 'g'),\n  to: 'bar',\n};\n```\n\n### Using callbacks for `to`\nAs the `to` parameter is passed to the native [String replace method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace), you can also specify a callback. The following example uses a callback to convert matching strings to lowercase:\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  files: 'path/to/file',\n  from: /SomePattern[A-Za-z-]+/g,\n  to: (match) => match.toLowerCase(),\n};\n```\n\nThis callback provides for an extra argument above the String replace method, which is the name of the file in which the replacement is being performed. The following example replaces the matched string with the filename:\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  files: 'path/to/file',\n  from: /SomePattern[A-Za-z-]+/g,\n  to: (...args) => args.pop(),\n};\n```\n\n### Ignore a single file or glob\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  ignore: 'path/to/ignored/file',\n};\n```\n\n### Ignore multiple files or globs\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  ignore: [\n    'path/to/ignored/file',\n    'path/to/other/ignored_file',\n    'path/to/ignored_files/*.html',\n    'another/**/*.ignore',\n  ],\n};\n```\n\nPlease note that there is an [open issue with Glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/issues/309) that causes ignored patterns to be ignored when using a `./` prefix in your files glob. To work around this, simply remove the prefix, e.g. use `**/*` instead of `./**/*`.\n\n### Allow empty/invalid paths\nIf set to true, empty or invalid paths will fail silently and no error will be thrown. For asynchronous replacement only. Defaults to `false`.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  allowEmptyPaths: true,\n};\n```\n\n### Disable globs\nYou can disable globs if needed using this flag. Use this when you run into issues with file paths like files like `//SERVER/share/file.txt`. Defaults to `false`.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  disableGlobs: true,\n};\n```\n\n### Specify glob configuration\nSpecify configuration passed to the [glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) call:\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  glob: {\n    //Glob settings here\n    dot: true, //E.g. to include file names starting with a dot\n  },\n};\n```\n\nPlease note that the setting `nodir` will always be passed as `false`.\n\n### Making replacements on network drives\nTo make replacements in files on network drives, you may need to specify the UNC path as the `cwd` config option. This will then be passed to glob and prefixed to your paths accordingly. See [#56](https://github.com/adamreisnz/replace-in-file/issues/56) for more details.\n\n### Specify character encoding\nUse a different character encoding for reading/writing files. Defaults to `utf-8`.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  encoding: 'utf8',\n};\n```\n\n### Dry run\nTo do a dry run without actually making replacements, for testing purposes. Defaults to `false`.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  dry: true,\n};\n```\n\n## CLI usage\n\n```sh\nreplace-in-file from to some/file.js,some/**/glob.js\n  [--configFile=replace-config.js]\n  [--ignore=ignore/files.js,ignore/**/glob.js]\n  [--encoding=utf-8]\n  [--disableGlobs]\n  [--isRegex]\n  [--verbose]\n  [--quiet]\n  [--dry]\n```\n\nMultiple files or globs can be replaced by providing a comma separated list.\n\nThe flags `--disableGlobs`, `--ignore` and `--encoding` are supported in the CLI.\n\nThe setting `allowEmptyPaths` is not supported in the CLI as the replacement is\nsynchronous, and this setting is only relevant for asynchronous replacement.\n\nTo list the changed files, use the `--verbose` flag. Success output can be suppressed by using the `--quiet` flag.\n\nTo do a dry run without making any actual changes, use `--dry`.\n\nA regular expression may be used for the `from` parameter by specifying the `--isRegex` flag.\n\nThe `from` and `to` parameters, as well as the files list, can be omitted if you provide this\ninformation in a configuration file. You can provide a path to a configuration file\n(either Javascript or JSON) with the `--configFile` flag. This path will be resolved using\nNode’s built in `path.resolve()`, so you can pass in an absolute or relative path.\n\n## A note on using globs with the CLI\nWhen using the CLI, the glob pattern is handled by the operating system. But if you specify the glob pattern in the configuration file, the package will use the glob module from the Node modules, and this can lead to different behaviour despite using the same pattern.\n\nFor example, the following will only look at top level files:\n\n```js\n//config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  from: /cat/g,\n  to: 'dog',\n};\n```\n\n```sh\nreplace-in-file **  --configFile=config.js\n```\n\nHowever, this example is recursive:\n\n```js\n//config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  files: '**',\n  from: /cat/g,\n  to: 'dog',\n};\n```\n\n```sh\nreplace-in-file --configFile=config.js\n```\n\nIf you want to do a recursive file search as an argument you must use:\n\n```sh\nreplace-in-file $(ls l {,**/}*)  --configFile=config.js\n```\n\n## Version information\nFrom version 3.0.0 onwards, replace in file requires Node 6 or higher. If you need support for Node 4 or 5, please use version 2.x.x.\n\nFrom version 5.0.0 onwards, replace in file requires Node 8 or higher. If you need support for Node 6, please use version 4.x.x.\n\nSee the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for more information.\n\n## License\n(MIT License)\n\nCopyright 2015-2023, Adam Reis, Co-founder at [Hello Club](https://helloclub.com/?source=npm) and [Frello](https://getfrello.com/?source=npm)",

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\r\n\r\nYou must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\r\n\r\nYou must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and\r\n\r\nYou must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\r\n\r\nIf the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\r\n\r\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\r\n\r\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\r\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS",
