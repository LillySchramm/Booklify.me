If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

The script is shipped as a separate package. Run the following command to install it:\n\n```sh\nnpm i --save-dev @ngneat/until-destroy-migration\n# Or if you use yarn\nyarn add -D @ngneat/until-destroy-migration\n```\n\nThen run the following command:\n\n```shell script\nnpx @ngneat/until-destroy-migration --base my/path\n```\n\n`base` defaults to `./src/app`.\n\nYou can use the `--removeOnDestroy` flag for empty `OnDestroy` methods removing.\n\n```shell script\nnpx @ngneat/until-destroy-migration --removeOnDestroy\n```\n\nYou can remove the package once the migration is done.\n\n## Potential Pitfalls\n\n- The order of decorators is important, make sure to put `@UntilDestroy()` before the `@Component()` decorator.\n- When using [`overrideComponent`](https://angular.io/api/core/testing/TestBed#overrideComponent) in unit tests remember that it overrides metadata and component definition. Invoke `UntilDestroy()(YourComponent);` to reapply the decorator. See [here](https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy/issues/91#issuecomment-626470446) for an example.\n\n## ESLint Rules\n\n- [prefer-takeuntil](https://github.com/cartant/eslint-plugin-rxjs-angular/blob/main/docs/rules/prefer-takeuntil.md#options)\n- [no-unsafe-takeuntil](https://github.com/cartant/eslint-plugin-rxjs/blob/main/docs/rules/no-unsafe-takeuntil.md#options)\n\n## Contributors ✨\n\nThanks goes to these wonderful people ([emoji key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key)):\n\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:START - Do not remove or modify this section -->\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n<!-- markdownlint-disable -->\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://www.netbasal.com\"><img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/6745730?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Netanel Basal</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy/commits?author=NetanelBasal\" title=\"Code\">💻</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy/commits?author=NetanelBasal\" title=\"Documentation\">📖</a> <a href=\"#ideas-NetanelBasal\" title=\"Ideas, Planning, & Feedback\">🤔</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/@overthesanity\"><img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7337691?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Artur Androsovych</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy/commits?author=arturovt\" title=\"Code\">💻</a> <a href=\"#example-arturovt\" title=\"Examples\">💡</a> <a href=\"#ideas-arturovt\" title=\"Ideas, Planning, & Feedback\">🤔</a> <a href=\"#infra-arturovt\" title=\"Infrastructure (Hosting, Build-Tools, etc)\">🚇</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/KrzysztofKarol\"><img src=\"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/12470911?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Krzysztof Karol</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"#content-KrzysztofKarol\" title=\"Content\">🖋</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/gund\"><img src=\"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/3644678?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Alex Malkevich</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy/commits?author=gund\" title=\"Code\">💻</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/webdevius\"><img src=\"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2960769?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Khaled Shaaban</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy/commits?author=webdevius\" title=\"Code\">💻</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/kmathy\"><img src=\"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/15690980?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>kmathy</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy/commits?author=kmathy\" title=\"Code\">💻</a></td>\n    <td align=\"center\"><a href=\"https://github.com/FFKL\"><img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11336491?v=4\" width=\"100px;\" alt=\"\"/><br /><sub><b>Dmitrii Korostelev</b></sub></a><br /><a href=\"https://github.com/ngneat/until-destroy/commits?author=FFKL\" title=\"Code\">💻</a></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<!-- markdownlint-enable -->\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n\n<!-- ALL-CONTRIBUTORS-LIST:END -->\n\nThis project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors) specification.

Please see\n[OpenAPITools/openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator).\n\nThe OpenAPI Generator is a Java project. `openapi-generator-cli` will download the appropriate JAR file and invoke the `java` executable to run the OpenAPI Generator. You must have the `java` binary executable available on your `PATH` for this to work.\n\nIf you find this tool useful, please consider sponsoring this project financially via https://opencollective.com/openapi_generator or directly to [Kay Schecker](https://github.com/sponsors/kay-schecker) (the author of this tool) :pray:\n\n---\n\n## Version 2.x.x\n\n#### [update] The command has been renamed\n\nYou need to execute `openapi-generator-cli` instead of `openapi-generator` from now on.\n\n#### [added] [semver](https://semver.org/) support! 🎉\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator-cli/blob/master/img/vm.gif?raw=true\"/></p>\n\nTo make that happen, a version management was added to the package.\nThe first time you run the command `openapi-generator-cli` the last stable version \nof [OpenAPITools/openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) is downloaded by default. \n\nThat version is saved in the file *openapitools.json*. Therefore you should include this file in your version control, \nto ensure that the correct version is being used next time you call the command.\n\nIf you would like to use a different version of the [OpenAPITools/openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator), \nyou could change it by using one of the following commands:\n \n- `openapi-generator-cli version-manager list` \n- `openapi-generator-cli version-manager set  <versionTags...>`\n\n#### [added] generator config\n\nYou will now be able to configure the code generation in *openapitools.json*. \nThis makes it more convenient to generate code for every file that matches the given glob expression.\nFor more information, [please check out the configuration documentation below](#configuration).\n\n## Installation\n\n### Locally (recommended)\n\n```sh\nnpm install @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli\n```\n\nor using yarn\n\n```sh\nyarn add @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli\n```\n\nAfter the installation has finished you can run `npx openapi-generator-cli` or add a script like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-cool-package\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"my-awesome-script-name\": \"openapi-generator-cli generate -i docs/openapi.yaml -g typescript-angular -o generated-sources/openapi --additional-properties=ngVersion=6.1.7,npmName=restClient,supportsES6=true,npmVersion=6.9.0,withInterfaces=true\",\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote the whitespace sensitivity when using multiple additional-properties:\n\n```text\n--additional-properties=ngVersion=6.1.7,npmName=restClient,supportsES6=true,npmVersion=6.9.0,withInterfaces=true\n```\n\n### Globally\n\n```sh\nnpm install -g @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli\n```\n\nor using yarn\n\n```sh\nyarn global add @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli\n```\n\nAfter the installation has finished you can run `openapi-generator-cli`\n\n## Usage\n\nMac/Linux:\n```\nopenapi-generator-cli generate -g ruby -i https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/3_0/petstore.yaml -o /var/tmp/ruby-client\n```\n\nWindows:\n```\nopenapi-generator-cli generate -g ruby -i https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/master/modules/openapi-generator/src/test/resources/3_0/petstore.yaml -o C:\\temp\\ruby-client\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nIf you have installed the package locally and executed the command `openapi-generator-cli` at least once, \nyou will find a new file called *openapitools.json* along with the *package.json*. **Please add this file to your VCS.** \n\nInitially the file has the following content:\n\n```json5\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"node_modules/@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli/config.schema.json\",\n  \"spaces\": 2,\n  \"generator-cli\": {\n    \"version\": \"4.3.1\" // or the current latest version ;)\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis configuration indicates the following:\n\n- the json file shall be formatted using **2 spaces**\n- the jar files shall be downloaded to *./my/custom/storage/dir*\n- the generator-cli version 4.3.1 is used\n\nFurther it is also possible to configure generators, for example:\n\n```json5\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"node_modules/@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli/config.schema.json\",\n  \"spaces\": 2,\n  \"generator-cli\": {\n    \"version\": \"4.3.1\",\n    \"storageDir\": \"~/my/custom/storage/dir\", // optional\n    \"generators\": { // optional\n      \"v2.0\": { // any name you like (just printed to the console log or reference it using --generator-key) \n        \"generatorName\": \"typescript-angular\",\n        \"output\": \"#{cwd}/output/v2.0/#{ext}/#{name}\",\n        \"glob\": \"examples/v2.0/{json,yaml}/*.{json,yaml}\",\n        \"additionalProperties\": {\n          \"ngVersion\": \"6.1.7\",\n          \"npmName\": \"restClient\",\n          \"supportsES6\": \"true\",\n          \"npmVersion\": \"6.9.0\",\n          \"withInterfaces\": true\n        }\n      },\n      \"v3.0\": { // any name you like (just printed to the console log or reference it using --generator-key) \n        \"generatorName\": \"typescript-fetch\",\n        \"output\": \"#{cwd}/output/v3.0/#{ext}/#{name}\",\n        \"glob\": \"examples/v3.0/petstore.{json,yaml}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf `openapi-generator-cli generate` is called without further arguments, then the configuration \nis automatically used to generate your code. 🎉\n\n\n##### Available placeholders\n     \n| placeholder  | description

       |\n\n### Using custom / private maven registry \n\nIf you're using a private maven registry you can configure the `downloadUrl` and `queryUrl` like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"node_modules/@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli/config.schema.json\",\n  \"spaces\": 2,\n  \"generator-cli\": {\n    \"version\": \"5.3.0\",\n    \"repository\": {\n      \"queryUrl\": \"https://private.maven.intern/solrsearch/select?q=g:${group.id}+AND+a:${artifact.id}&core=gav&start=0&rows=200\",\n      \"downloadUrl\": \"https://private.maven.intern/maven2/${groupId}/${artifactId}/${versionName}/${artifactId}-${versionName}.jar\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf the `version` property param is set it is not necessary to configure the `queryUrl`.\n\n## Run specific generators\n\n| cmd                                                      | v3.0 runs | v2.0 runs |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| openapi-generator-cli generate --generator-key v3.0      | yes       | no        |\n| openapi-generator-cli generate --generator-key v3.0 v2.0 | yes       | yes       |\n| openapi-generator-cli generate --generator-key foo       | no        | no        |\n\n## Use Docker instead of running java locally\n\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"node_modules/@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli/config.schema.json\",\n  \"spaces\": 2,\n  \"generator-cli\": {\n    \"useDocker\": true\n  }\n}\n```\nIf `useDocker` option is used, the spec file gets mounted to path `/local/<your-spec-file-location>` within container. So, if you would configure spec file as \n`-i openapi/my-api.yml` if running locally, with useDocker option set, you would have to configure it like this: `-i /local/openapi/my-api.yml`.\n\n## Custom Generators\n\nCustom generators can be used by passing the `--custom-generator=/my/custom-generator.jar` argument.\n\n## Further Documentation\n\nPlease refer to the [official openapi-generator docs](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator#3---usage) for\nmore information about the possible arguments and a detailed usage manual of the command line interface.\n\n## Install previous version\n\n```sh\nnpm install @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli@previous\nnpm i @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli@1.0.18-4.3.1                                         \n```\n\nor using yarn\n\n```sh\nyarn add @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli@previous\nyarn add @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli@1.0.18-4.3.1\n```\n\n## You like the package?\n\nPlease leave a star.",

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

To differentiate, the options parameter in the `connect()`\nfunction includes a `secureEndpoint` property, which can be checked\nto determine what type of socket should be returned.\n\n#### Some subclasses:\n\nHere are some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.\nSend a pull request to list yours!\n\n * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints\n * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints\n * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS\n\nExample\n-------\n\nHere's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` or `tls.Socket`\nbased on the `secureEndpoint` property. This agent can be used with both\nthe `http` and `https` modules.\n\n```ts\nimport * as net from 'net';\nimport * as tls from 'tls';\nimport * as http from 'http';\nimport { Agent } from 'agent-base';\n\nclass MyAgent extends Agent {\n  connect(req, opts) {\n    // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the \"https\" module\n    if (opts.secureEndpoint) {\n      return tls.connect(opts);\n    } else {\n      return net.connect(opts);\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n// Keep alive enabled means that `connect()` will only be\n// invoked when a new connection needs to be created\nconst agent = new MyAgent({ keepAlive: true });\n\n// Pass the `agent` option when creating the HTTP request\nhttp.get('http://nodejs.org/api/', { agent }, (res) => {\n  console.log('\"response\" event!', res.headers);\n  res.pipe(process.stdout);\n});\n```\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[http-proxy-agent]: ../http-proxy-agent\n[https-proxy-agent]: ../https-proxy-agent\n[pac-proxy-agent]: ../pac-proxy-agent\n[socks-proxy-agent]: ../socks-proxy-agent\n[http.Agent]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent",

You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\nthe various releases.\n\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                    from                                compatible?

All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.

Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.\n\n###And why is this a separate module?\n\nI'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions.

Couldn't get one of the examples running? Have your own sweet setup that you want to show off to the world?\nWe'd love to receive your feedback and contributions - so please get in touch! We aim to make this project the canonical source \nof example projects & code snippets related to running Browsersync.\n\n### How to contribute an example\n\nFirst thing you should do, is take a look at our [simplest example here](https://github.com/Browsersync/recipes/tree/master/recipes/server) - \nthis will give you a great head-start on setting up your code.\n\nThen, `fork` this repo and `clone` your fork down to your local machine. Now create a new folder inside `recipes`\n(note the naming structure). This is where you create your awesome example. You're free to do as you like,\nbut there are a couple of rules you'll need to follow to ensure the project can build.\n\n**Required Files**\n\n- `package.json` (see below for requirements)\n- `app.js` (or any JS file showing the example)\n- `./app` directory. Always include the minimum HTML, JS & CSS needed to prove your example.\n\n**Do NOT include**\n- `readme.md` (this is created dynamically for you)\n- any other files that are not related to your example.\n\n\n### package.json requirements\n\n\n**start command**: For consistency, ensure your example can be run with the command `npm start`. To \ndo this, you just need to provide something along these lines:\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n    \"start\": \"node app.js\"\n},\n```\n\n**main file**: We inline your main Javascript file into the `readme.md`, so\ndon't miss this field.\n\n```json\n\"main\": \"app.js\" // or gulpfile.js etc\n```\n\n**description**: We use this as the Title. So make it short and descriptive, such as \n\n```json\n\"description\": \"Server example\"\n```\n\n### Finally, build.\nAfter you've added your example in the recipes folder, return to the root and run\n\n```bash\nnpm install && npm run build\n```\n\nThis will install [Crossbow.js](https://github.com/shakyShane/crossbow.js) and compile the project.\nCommit everything that has changed and push it up to your fork. Send a Pull Request when you're\nready, or if you'd like us to have a look over your code before that, just ping us [twitter](https://twitter.com/browsersync) and we'll \ntake a look!",

The\nfollowing considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\nexhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\n     intended for use by those authorized to give the public\n     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\n     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\n     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\n     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\n     licensed material, or material used under an exception or\n     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:\n\twiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\n     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations\n     for the public: \n\twiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensees\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License\n\nBy exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree\nto be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons\nAttribution 4.0 International Public License (\"Public License\"). To the\nextent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are\ngranted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of\nthese terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in\nconsideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the\nLicensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\n     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,\n     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or\n     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n\n  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright\n     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of\n     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,\n     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially\n     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\n  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

But don't forget to whitelist it for transpilation:\n\n```js\nimport consola from 'consola/src/node'\nimport consola from 'consola/src/browser'\n```\n\n## Methods\n\n#### `<type>(logObject)` `<type>(args...)`\n\nLog to all reporters.\n\nExample: `consola.info('Message')`\n\nA list of available types can be found [here](./src/types.js).\n\n#### `addReporter(reporter)`\n\n- Aliases: `add`\n\nRegister a custom reporter instance.\n\n#### `removeReporter(reporter?)`\n\n- Aliases: `remove`, `clear`\n\nRemove a registered reporter.\n\nIf no arguments are passed all reporters will be removed.\n\n#### `setReporters(reporter|reporter[])`\n\nReplace all reporters.\n\n#### `create(options)`\n\nCreate a new `Consola` instance and inherit all parent options for defaults.\n\n#### `withDefaults(defaults)`\n\nCreate a new `Consola` instance with provided defaults\n\n#### `withTag(tag)`\n\n- Aliases: `withScope`\n\nCreate a new `Consola` instance with that tag.\n\n#### `wrapConsole()` `restoreConsole()`\n\nGlobally redirect all `console.log`, etc calls to consola handlers.\n\n#### `wrapStd()` `restoreStd()`\n\nGlobally redirect all stdout/stderr outputs to consola.\n\n#### `wrapAll()` `restoreAll()`\n\nWrap both, std and console.\n\nconsole uses std in the underlying so calling `wrapStd` redirects console too.\nBenefit of this function is that things like `console.info` will be correctly redirected to the corresponding type.\n\n#### `pauseLogs()` `resumeLogs()`\n\n- Aliases: `pause`/`resume`\n\n**Globally** pause and resume logs.\n\nConsola will enqueue all logs when paused and then sends them to the reported when resumed.\n\n#### `mockTypes`\n\n- Aliases: `mock`\n\nMock all types. Useful for using with tests.\n\nThe first argument passed to `mockTypes` should be a callback function accepting `(typeName, type)` and returning the mocked value:\n\n```js\nconsola.mockTypes((typeName, type) => jest.fn())\n```\n\nPlease note that with the example above, everything is mocked independently for each type. If you need one mocked fn create it outside:\n\n```js\nconst fn = jest.fn()\nconsola.mockTypes(() => fn)\n```\n\nIf callback function returns a _falsy_ value, that type won't be mocked.\n\nFor example if you just need to mock `consola.fatal`:\n\n```js\nconsola.mockTypes((typeName) => typeName === 'fatal' && jest.fn())\n```\n\n**NOTE:** Any instance of consola that inherits the mocked instance, will apply provided callback again.\nThis way, mocking works for `withTag` scoped loggers without need to extra efforts.\n\n## Fields\n\n#### `reporters`\n\nAn array of active reporters.\n\n#### `level`\n\nThe level to display logs. Any logs at or above this level will be displayed.\nList of available levels [here](./src/types.js).\n\nYou can set the log level using the `CONSOLA_LEVEL` environment variable, which must have the numeric log level as its value.\n\n## `logObject`\n\nThe `logObject` is a free-to-extend object which will be passed to reporters.\n\nStandard fields:\n\n- `message`\n- `additional`\n- `args`\n- `date`\n- `tag`\n\nExtra fields:\n\n- `badge`\n\n## Reporters\n\nChoose between one of the built-in reporters or bring in your own one.\n\nBy default `FancyReporter` is registered for modern terminals or `BasicReporter` will be used if running in limited environments such as CIs.\n\nAvailable reporters:\n\n- [BasicReporter](./src/reporters/basic.js)\n- [FancyReporter](./src/reporters/fancy.js)\n- [JSONReporter](./src/reporters/json.js)\n- [WinstonReporter](./src/reporters/winston.js)\n\n### Creating your own reporter\n\nA reporter (class or object) exposes `log(logObj)` method.\nTo get more info about how to write your own reporter, take a look into the linked implementations above.\n\n## Types\n\nTypes are used to actually log messages to the reporters.\nEach type is attached to a _logging level_.\n\nA list of all available default types is [here](./src/types.js).\n\n## Creating a new instance\n\nConsola has a global instance and is recommended to use everywhere.\nIn case more control is needed, create a new instance.\n\n```js\nimport consola from 'consola'\n\nconst logger = consola.create({\n    // level: 4,\n    reporters: [\n      new consola.JSONReporter()\n    ],\n    defaults: {\n      additionalColor: 'white'\n    }\n})\n```\n\n## Integrations\n\n### With jest\n\n```js\ndescribe('your-consola-mock-test', () => {\n  beforeAll(() => {\n      // Redirect std and console to consola too\n      // Calling this once is sufficient\n      consola.wrapAll()\n    })\n\n    beforeEach(() => {\n      // Re-mock consola before each test call to remove\n      // calls from before\n      consola.mockTypes(() => jest.fn())\n    })\n\n\n  test('your test', async () => {\n    // Some code here\n\n    // Let's retrieve all messages of `consola.log`\n    // Get the mock and map all calls to their first argument\n    const consolaMessages = consola.log.mock.calls.map(c => c[0])\n    expect(consolaMessages).toContain('your message')\n  })\n\n})\n```\n\n### With jsdom\n\n```js\n{\n  virtualConsole: new jsdom.VirtualConsole().sendTo(consola)\n}\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT - Made with 💖 By Nuxt.js team!\n\n<!-- Refs -->\n[standard-js-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/badge/code%20style/standard/green\n[standard-js-href]: https://standardjs.com\n\n[npm-version-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/npm/v/consola/latest\n[npm-version-href]: https://npmjs.com/package/consola\n\n[npm-downloads-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/npm/dt/consola\n[npm-downloads-href]: https://npmjs.com/package/consola\n\n[package-phobia-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/packagephobia/install/consola\n[package-phobia-href]: https://packagephobia.now.sh/result?p=consola\n\n[bundle-phobia-src]: https://flat.badgen.net/bundlephobia/minzip/consola\n[bundle-phobia-href]: https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=consola",

This tradeoff allows Critters to be very **fast and lightweight**. It also means Critters inlines all CSS rules used by your document, rather than only those needed for above-the-fold content. For alternatives, see [Similar Libraries](#similar-libraries).\n\nCritters' design makes it a good fit when inlining critical CSS for prerendered/SSR'd Single Page Applications. It was developed to be an excellent compliment to [prerender-loader](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/prerender-loader), combining to dramatically improve first paint time for most Single Page Applications.\n\n## Features\n\n- Fast - no browser, few dependencies\n- Integrates with Webpack [critters-webpack-plugin]\n- Supports preloading and/or inlining critical fonts\n- Prunes unused CSS keyframes and media queries\n- Removes inlined CSS rules from lazy-loaded stylesheets\n\n## Installation\n\nFirst, install Critters as a development dependency:\n\n```sh\nnpm i -D critters\n```\n\nor\n\n```sh\nyarn add -D critters\n```\n\n## Simple Example\n\n```js\nimport Critters from 'critters';\n\nconst critters = new Critters({\n  // optional configuration (see below)\n});\n\nconst html = `\n  <style>\n    .red { color: red }\n    .blue { color: blue }\n  </style>\n  <div class=\"blue\">I'm Blue</div>\n`;\n\nconst inlined = await critters.process(html);\n\nconsole.log(inlined);\n// \"<style>.blue{color:blue}</style><div class=\\\"blue\\\">I'm Blue</div>\"\n```\n\n## Usage with webpack\n\nCritters is also available as a Webpack plugin called [critters-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.org/package/critters-webpack-plugin). [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/critters-webpack-plugin.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/critters-webpack-plugin)\n\nThe Webpack plugin supports the same configuration options as the main `critters` package:\n\n```diff\n// webpack.config.js\n+const Critters = require('critters-webpack-plugin');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [\n+    new Critters({\n+      // optional configuration\n+      preload: 'swap',\n+      includeSelectors: [/^\\.btn/, '.banner'],\n+    })\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThat's it! The resultant html will have its critical CSS inlined and the stylesheets lazy-loaded.\n\n## Usage\n\n<!-- Generated by documentation.js. Update this documentation by updating the source code. -->\n\n### Critters\n\nAll optional. Pass them to `new Critters({ ... })`.\n\n#### Parameters\n\n- `options`\n\n#### Properties\n\n- `path` **[String](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** Base path location of the CSS files _(default: `''`)_\n- `publicPath` **[String](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** Public path of the CSS resources.

By default inline style tags will be evaluated and rewritten to only contain critical CSS. Set it to `false` to skip processing inline styles. _(default: `true`)_\n- `preload` **[String](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** Which [preload strategy](#preloadstrategy) to use\n- `noscriptFallback` **[Boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** Add `<noscript>` fallback to JS-based strategies\n- `inlineFonts` **[Boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** Inline critical font-face rules _(default: `false`)_\n- `preloadFonts` **[Boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** Preloads critical fonts _(default: `true`)_\n- `fonts` **[Boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** Shorthand for setting `inlineFonts` + `preloadFonts`\\* Values:\n  - `true` to inline critical font-face rules and preload the fonts\n  - `false` to don't inline any font-face rules and don't preload fonts\n- `keyframes` **[String](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** Controls which keyframes rules are inlined.\\* Values:\n  - `\"critical\"`: _(default)_ inline keyframes rules used by the critical CSS\n  - `\"all\"` inline all keyframes rules\n  - `\"none\"` remove all keyframes rules\n- `compress` **[Boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** Compress resulting critical CSS _(default: `true`)_\n- `logLevel` **[String](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** Controls [log level](#loglevel) of the plugin _(default: `\"info\"`)_\n- `logger` **[object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** Provide a custom logger interface [logger](#logger)\n- `includeSelectors` **[RegExp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp)** | **[String](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** Provide a list of selectors that should be included in the critical CSS. Accepts both RegExp and string.\n\n### Include/exclude rules\n\nWe can include or exclude rules to be part of critical CSS by adding comments in the CSS\n\nSingle line comments to include/exclude the next CSS rule\n\n```css\n/* critters:exclude */\n.selector1 {\n  /* this rule will be excluded from critical CSS */\n}\n\n.selector2 {\n  /* this will be evaluated normally */\n}\n\n/* critters:include */\n.selector3 {\n  /* this rule will be included in the critical CSS */\n}\n\n.selector4 {\n  /* this will be evaluated normally */\n}\n```\n\nIncluding/Excluding multiple rules by adding start and end markers\n\n```css\n/* critters:exclude start */\n\n.selector1 {\n  /* this rule will be excluded from critical CSS */\n}\n\n.selector2 {\n  /* this rule will be excluded from critical CSS */\n}\n\n/* critters:exclude end */\n```\n\n```css\n/* critters:include start */\n\n.selector3 {\n  /* this rule will be included in the critical CSS */\n}\n\n.selector4 {\n  /* this rule will be included in the critical CSS */\n}\n\n/* critters:include end */\n```\n\n### Critters container\n\nBy default Critters evaluates the CSS against the entire input HTML. Critters evaluates the Critical CSS by reconstructing the entire DOM and evaluating the CSS selectors to find matching nodes. Usually this works well as Critters is lightweight and fast.\n\nFor some cases, the input HTML can be very large or deeply nested which makes the reconstructed DOM much larger, which in turn can slow down the critical CSS generation. Critters is not aware of viewport size and what specific nodes are above the fold since there is not a headless browser involved.\n\nTo overcome this issue Critters makes use of **Critters containers**.\n\nA Critters container mimics the viewport and can be enabled by adding `data-critters-container` into the top level container thats contains the HTML elements above the fold.\n\nYou can estimate the contents of your viewport roughly and add a <div `data-critters-container` > around the contents.\n\n```html\n<html>\n  <body>\n    <div class=\"container\">\n      <div data-critters-container>\n        /* HTML inside this container are used to evaluate critical CSS */\n      </div>\n      /* HTML is ignored when evaluating critical CSS */\n    </div>\n    <footer></footer>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n_Note: This is an easy way to improve the performance of Critters_\n\n### Logger\n\nCustom logger interface:\n\nType: [object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)\n\n#### Properties\n\n- `trace` **function ([String](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String))** Prints a trace message\n- `debug` **function ([String](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String))** Prints a debug message\n- `info` **function ([String](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String))** Prints an information message\n- `warn` **function ([String](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String))** Prints a warning message\n- `error` **function ([String](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String))** Prints an error message\n\n### LogLevel\n\nControls log level of the plugin. Specifies the level the logger should use. A logger will\nnot produce output for any log level beneath the specified level. Available levels and order\nare:\n\n- **\"info\"** _(default)_\n- **\"warn\"**\n- **\"error\"**\n- **\"trace\"**\n- **\"debug\"**\n- **\"silent\"**\n\nType: (`\"info\"` | `\"warn\"` | `\"error\"` | `\"trace\"` | `\"debug\"` | `\"silent\"`)\n\n### PreloadStrategy\n\nThe mechanism to use for lazy-loading stylesheets.\n\nNote: <kbd>JS</kbd> indicates a strategy requiring JavaScript (falls back to `<noscript>` unless disabled).\n\n- **default:** Move stylesheet links to the end of the document and insert preload meta tags in their place.\n- **\"body\":** Move all external stylesheet links to the end of the document.\n- **\"media\":** Load stylesheets asynchronously by adding `media=\"not x\"` and removing once loaded. <kbd>JS</kbd>\n- **\"swap\":** Convert stylesheet links to preloads that swap to `rel=\"stylesheet\"` once loaded ([details](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/load-css-simpler/#the-code)). <kbd>JS</kbd>\n- **\"swap-high\":** Use `<link rel=\"alternate stylesheet preload\">` and swap to `rel=\"stylesheet\"` once loaded ([details](http://filamentgroup.github.io/loadCSS/test/new-high.html)). <kbd>JS</kbd>\n- **\"js\":** Inject an asynchronous CSS loader similar to [LoadCSS](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS) and use it to load stylesheets. <kbd>JS</kbd>\n- **\"js-lazy\":** Like `\"js\"`, but the stylesheet is disabled until fully loaded.\n- **false:** Disables adding preload tags.\n\nType: (default | `\"body\"` | `\"media\"` | `\"swap\"` | `\"swap-high\"` | `\"js\"` | `\"js-lazy\"`)\n\n## Similar Libraries\n\nThere are a number of other libraries that can inline Critical CSS, each with a slightly different approach. Here are a few great options:\n\n- [Critical](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical)\n- [Penthouse](https://github.com/pocketjoso/penthouse)\n- [webpack-critical](https://github.com/lukeed/webpack-critical)\n- [webpack-plugin-critical](https://github.com/nrwl/webpack-plugin-critical)\n- [html-critical-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/anthonygore/html-critical-webpack-plugin)\n- [react-snap](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap)\n\n## License\n\n[Apache 2.0](LICENSE)\n\nThis is not an official Google product.\n\n[critters-webpack-plugin]: https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/critters/tree/main/packages/critters-webpack-plugin\n[critical css]: https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/08/understanding-critical-css/\n[html-webpack-plugin]: https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin",

        "licenseText": "# Easy table\n\nNice utility for rendering text tables with javascript.\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar Table = require('easy-table')\n\nvar data = [\n  { id: 123123, desc: 'Something awesome', price: 1000.00 },\n  { id: 245452, desc: 'Very interesting book', price: 11.45},\n  { id: 232323, desc: 'Yet another product', price: 555.55 }\n]\n\nvar t = new Table\n\ndata.forEach(function(product) {\n  t.cell('Product Id', product.id)\n  t.cell('Description', product.desc)\n  t.cell('Price, USD', product.price, Table.number(2))\n  t.newRow()\n})\n\nconsole.log(t.toString())\n```\n\nThe script above will render:\n\n```\nProduct Id  Description            Price, USD\n----------  ---------------------  ----------\n123123      Something awesome         1000.00\n245452      Very interesting book       11.45\n232323      Yet another product        555.55\n```\n\n`t.printTransposed()` returns\n\n```\nProduct Id  : 245452                : 232323              : 123123\nDescription : Very interesting book : Yet another product : Something awesome\nPrice, USD  : 11.45                 : 555.55              : 1000.00\n```\n\n`t.print()` shows just rows you pushed and nothing more\n\n```\n123123  Something awesome      1000.00\n245452  Very interesting book    11.45\n232323  Yet another product     555.55\n```\n\n### How it works\n\nThe full signature of `.cell()` is:\n\n```javascript\nt.cell(column, value, printer)\n```\n\nRendering occures in two phases. At the first phase `printer`\nis called to get the minimal width required to fit the cell content.\nAt the second phase `printer` is called again with\nadditional `width` parameter to get actual string to render.\n\nFor example, here is how currency printer might be defined\n\n``` javascript\nfunction currency(val, width) {\n  var str = val.toFixed(2)\n  return width ? Table.padLeft(str, width) : str\n}\n```\n\n### Table.print()\n\nWhen you already have an array, explicit table instantiation and iteration\nbecomes an overhead. For such cases it is convenient to use `Table.print()`.\n\n``` javascript\nconsole.log(Table.print(data))\n```\n\n```\nid      desc                   price\n------  ---------------------  ------\n123123  Something awesome      1000\n245452  Very interesting book  11.45\n232323  Yet another product    555.55\n```\n\nIt is possible to pass some options\n\n``` javascript\nTable.print(data, {\n  desc: {name: 'description'}\n  price: {printer: Table.number(2)}\n})\n```\n\n```\nid      description            price\n------  ---------------------  -------\n123123  Something awesome      1000.00\n245452  Very interesting book    11.45\n232323  Yet another product     555.55\n```\n\nor have a full control over rendering\n\n``` javascript\nTable.print(data, function(item, cell) {\n  cell('Product id', item.id)\n  cell('Price, USD', item.price)\n}, function(table) {\n  return table.print()\n})\n```\n\n`Table.print()` also accepts objects\n\n``` javascript\nTable.print(data[0])\n```\n\n```\nid    : 123123\ndesc  : Something awesome\nprice : 1000\n```\n\n### Sorting\n\nYou can sort a table by calling `.sort()`, and optionally passing in a list of\ncolumn names to sort on (by default uses all columns), or a custom comparator\nfunction. It is also possible to specify the sort order. For example:\n\n``` javascript\nt.sort(['Price, USD|des']) // will sort in descending order\nt.sort(['Price, USD|asc']) // will sort in ascending order\nt.sort(['Price, USD']) // sorts in ascending order by default\n```\n\n### Totaling\n\nEasy table can help to calculate and render totals:\n\n``` javascript\nt.total('Price, USD')\n```\n\n```\nProduct Id  Description            Price, USD\n----------  ---------------------  ----------\n245452      Very interesting book       11.45\n232323      Yet another product        555.55\n123123      Something awesome         1000.00\n----------  ---------------------  ----------\n                                      1567.00\n```\n\nHere is a more elaborate example\n\n```javascript\nt.total('Price, USD', {\n  printer: Table.aggr.printer('Avg: ', currency),\n  reduce: Table.aggr.avg,\n  init: 0\n})\n\n// or alternatively\n\nt.total('Price, USD', {\n  printer: function(val, width) {\n    return padLeft('Avg: ' + currency(val), width)\n  },\n  reduce: function(acc, val, idx, len) {\n    acc = acc + val\n    return idx + 1 == len ? acc/len : acc\n  }\n})\n```\n\n```\nProduct Id  Description            Price, USD\n----------  ---------------------  -----------\n245452      Very interesting book        11.45\n232323      Yet another product         555.55\n123123      Something awesome          1000.00\n----------  ---------------------  -----------\n                                   Avg: 522.33\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nvia npm\n\n```\n$ npm install easy-table\n```\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Eldar Gabdullin <eldargab@gmail.com>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.",

The `.stack` and `.message` properties will be carried over from the original error and `.code` or any passed properties will be set on it.\n\n\n## Tests\n\n`$ npm test`\n\n\n## License\n\nReleased under the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).",

Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.\n\n**By errno:**\n\n```js\nrequire('errno').errno[3]\n// → {\n//     \"errno\": 3,\n//     \"code\": \"EACCES\",\n//     \"description\": \"permission denied\"\n//   }\n```\n\n**By code:**\n\n```js\nrequire('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY\n// → {\n//     \"errno\": 53,\n//     \"code\": \"ENOTEMPTY\",\n//     \"description\": \"directory not empty\"\n//   }\n```\n\n**Make your errors more descriptive:**\n\n```js\nvar errno = require('errno')\n\nfunction errmsg(err) {\n  var str = 'Error: '\n  // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno\n  if (errno.errno[err.errno])\n    str += errno.errno[err.errno].description\n  else\n    str += err.message\n\n  // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property\n  if (err.path)\n    str += ' [' + err.path + ']'\n\n  return str\n}\n\nvar fs = require('fs')\n\nfs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {\n  if (err)\n    console.log(errmsg(err))\n})\n```\n\n**Use as a command line tool:**\n\n```\n~ $ errno 53\n{\n  \"errno\": 53,\n  \"code\": \"ENOTEMPTY\",\n  \"description\": \"directory not empty\"\n}\n~ $ errno EROFS\n{\n  \"errno\": 56,\n  \"code\": \"EROFS\",\n  \"description\": \"read-only file system\"\n}\n~ $ errno foo\nNo such errno/code: \"foo\"\n```\n\nSupply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.\n\nYou will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.\n\n<a name=\"customerrors\"></a>\n## Custom errors\n\nUse `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.\n\n```js\nvar create = require('errno').custom.createError\nvar MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error\nvar SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError\nvar OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)\n\n// use them!\nif (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')\n\nif (err) return callback(new OtherError(err))\n```\n\nAlso available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:\n\n```js\nfs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {\n  if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))\n  // do something else\n})\n```\n\nThe resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.\n\n## Contributors\n\n* [bahamas10](https://github.com/bahamas10) (Dave Eddy) - Added CLI\n* [ralphtheninja](https://github.com/ralphtheninja) (Lars-Magnus Skog)\n\n## Copyright & Licence\n\n*Copyright (c) 2012-2015 [Rod Vagg](https://github.com/rvagg) ([@rvagg](https://twitter.com/rvagg))*\n\nMade available under the MIT licence:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished\nto do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: 'iteration'\n    }\n);\n```\n\nIf the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.\nPlease note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: function (node) {\n            return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {\n                return key !== 'argument'\n            });\n        }\n    }\n);\n```\n\n### License\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 [Yusuke Suzuki](https://github.com/Constellation)\n (twitter: [@Constellation](https://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n    documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nARE DISCLAIMED.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].\n\nThe `proxy` argument is the URL for the proxy server.\n\nThe `options` argument accepts the usual `http.Agent` constructor options, and\nsome additional properties:\n\n * `headers` - Object containing additional headers to send to the proxy server\n   in the `CONNECT` request.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n[CONNECT]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_tunnel#HTTP_CONNECT_Tunneling",

        "licenseText": "iMurmurHash.js\n==============\n\nAn incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).\n\nThis version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install imurmurhash\n```\n\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\n\n```javascript\nMurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');\n```\n\nQuick Example\n-------------\n\n```javascript\n// Create the initial hash\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3('string');\n\n// Incrementally add text\nhashState.hash('more strings');\nhashState.hash('even more strings');\n\n// All calls can be chained if desired\nhashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');\n\n// Get a result\nhashState.result();\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\n```\n\nFunctions\n---------\n\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\n...\n\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\n```\n\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\n\n```javascript\n// Do the whole string at once\nMurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();\n// 0x70529328\n\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\nvar m = MurmurHash3('this is a');\nm.result();\n// 0xbfc4f834\nm.hash(' test string').result();\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\n```\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\nLicense (MIT)\n-------------\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This is typically the case when an 979-prefix ISBN-13 was converted to an ISBN-10 (which is wrong as 979-prefixed ISBNs can't have ISBN-10), and then re-converted to an ISBN-13 with the 978 prefix. This is soooo wrong, but data is a dirty place I'm afraid.\n```js\nISBN.audit('9784873113364')\n// {\n//   \"source\": \"9784873113364\",\n//   \"validIsbn\": true,\n//   \"groupname\": \"Japan\",\n//   \"clues\": []\n// }\n\nISBN.audit('9781090648525')\n// {\n//   \"source\": \"9781090648525\",\n//   \"validIsbn\": true,\n//   \"groupname\": \"English language\",\n//   \"clues\": [\n//     {\n//       \"message\": \"possible prefix error\",\n//       \"candidate\": \"979-10-90648-52-4\",\n//       \"groupname\": \"France\"\n//     }\n//   ]\n// }\n\nISBN.audit('978-1-0906-4852-4')\n// {\n//   \"source\":\"978-1-0906-4852-4\",\n//   \"validIsbn\":false,\n//   \"clues\":[\n//     {\n//       \"message\":\"checksum hints different prefix\",\n//       \"candidate\":\"979-10-90648-52-4\",\n//       \"groupname\":\"France\"\n//     }\n//   ]\n// }\n```\n\n### groups\n```js\nISBN.groups['978-99972']\n// => {\n//   name: 'Faroe Islands',\n//   ranges: [ [ '0', '4' ], [ '50', '89' ], [ '900', '999' ] ]\n// }\n```\n\n## CLI\n\nInstalling the module globally (`npm install -g isbn3`) will make the following commands available from your terminal.\n\nIf you installed locally (`npm install isbn3`), the command can be accessed from the project directory at `./node_modules/.bin`, or just by their filename in npm scripts.\n\n### isbn\n```sh\nisbn <isbn> <format>\n\nValid ISBN input examples:\n- 9781491574317\n- 978-1-4915-7431-7\n- 978-1491574317\n- isbn:9781491574317\n- 9781-hello-491574317\n- 030433376X\n- 0-304-33376-X\n\nFormats:\n- h: hyphen\n- n: no hyphen\n- 13: ISBN-13 without hyphen\n- 13h: ISBN-13 with hyphen (default)\n- 10: ISBN-10 without hyphen\n- 10h: ISBN-10 with hyphen\n- prefix, group, publisher, article, check, check10, check13: output ISBN part value\n- data: output all this data as JSON\n```\n\n### isbn-audit\nReturn the results of the [audit](#audit) function as JSON\n\n```sh\nisbn-audit <isbn>\n```\n\nThis command also accepts a stream of newline-delimited isbns and outputs a stream of newline-delimited JSON, where each line corresponds to an ISBN that is either invalid or that could be suspect of being malformed.

Unfortunately, those groups aren't fixed once for all, and we need to update those data periodically.\n\nOnce a month, a [CI job](https://github.com/inventaire/isbn3/blob/main/.github/workflows/auto_update_groups_data.yml) takes care of updating ISBN groups data and publishing a patch version:\n![Auto-update groups data](https://github.com/inventaire/isbn3/workflows/Update%20groups%20and%20publish/badge.svg)\n\nTo get the latest data, you thus just need to update to the latest version (beware of [breaking changes](https://github.com/inventaire/isbn3/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) if that makes you switch to a new major version though):\n\n```sh\nnpm install isbn3@latest\n```\n\n## See also\n* [isbn-groups](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isbn-groups): infer a language from an ISBN group",

It does not rely on browsers, DOM, or any JavaScript framework. Thus it's suited for websites, [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) projects, or anywhere that JavaScript can run.\n\nUpgrading from Jasmine 3.x? Check out the [upgrade guide](https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/upgrading_to_Jasmine_4.0).\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease read the [contributors' guide](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Installation\n\nThere are several different ways to install Jasmine, depending on your \nenvironment and how you'd like to use it. See the [Getting Started page](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/getting_started.html)\nfor details.\n\n## Usage\n\nSee the [documentation site](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/docs_home.html),\nparticularly the [Your First Suite tutorial](https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/your_first_suite)\nfor information on writing specs, and [the FAQ](https://jasmine.github.io/pages/faq.html).\n\n## Supported environments\n\nJasmine tests itself across popular browsers (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, and\nMicrosoft Edge) as well as Node.\n\n| Environment       | Supported versions |\n|-------------------|--------------------|\n| Node              | 12.17+, 14, 16, 18 |\n| Safari            | 14-16              |\n| Chrome            | Evergreen          |\n| Firefox           | Evergreen, 91, 102 |\n| Edge              | Evergreen          |\n\nFor evergreen browsers, each version of Jasmine is tested against the version of the browser that is available to us\nat the time of release. Other browsers, as well as older & newer versions of some supported browsers, are likely to work.\nHowever, Jasmine isn't tested against them and they aren't actively supported. \n\nTo find out what environments work with a particular Jasmine release, see the [release notes](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/tree/main/release_notes).\n\n## Maintainers\n\n* [Gwendolyn Van Hove](mailto:gwen@slackersoft.net)\n* [Steve Gravrock](mailto:sdg@panix.com)\n\n### Maintainers Emeritus\n\n* [Davis W.

It supports TTL based expiry, making it suitable as a cache or a persistent key-value store.\n\n## Features\n\nThere are a few existing modules similar to Keyv, however Keyv is different because it:\n\n- Isn't bloated\n- Has a simple Promise based API\n- Suitable as a TTL based cache or persistent key-value store\n- [Easily embeddable](#add-cache-support-to-your-module) inside another module\n- Works with any storage that implements the [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) API\n- Handles all JSON types plus `Buffer`\n- Supports namespaces\n- Wide range of [**efficient, well tested**](#official-storage-adapters) storage adapters\n- Connection errors are passed through (db failures won't kill your app)\n- Supports the current active LTS version of Node.js or higher\n\n## Usage\n\nInstall Keyv.\n\n```\nnpm install --save keyv\n```\n\nBy default everything is stored in memory, you can optionally also install a storage adapter.\n\n```\nnpm install --save @keyv/redis\nnpm install --save @keyv/mongo\nnpm install --save @keyv/sqlite\nnpm install --save @keyv/postgres\nnpm install --save @keyv/mysql\nnpm install --save @keyv/etcd\n```\n\nCreate a new Keyv instance, passing your connection string if applicable. Keyv will automatically load the correct storage adapter.\n\n```js\nconst Keyv = require('keyv');\n\n// One of the following\nconst keyv = new Keyv();\nconst keyv = new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379');\nconst keyv = new Keyv('mongodb://user:pass@localhost:27017/dbname');\nconst keyv = new Keyv('sqlite://path/to/database.sqlite');\nconst keyv = new Keyv('postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname');\nconst keyv = new Keyv('mysql://user:pass@localhost:3306/dbname');\nconst keyv = new Keyv('etcd://localhost:2379');\n\n// Handle DB connection errors\nkeyv.on('error', err => console.log('Connection Error', err));\n\nawait keyv.set('foo', 'expires in 1 second', 1000); // true\nawait keyv.set('foo', 'never expires'); // true\nawait keyv.get('foo'); // 'never expires'\nawait keyv.delete('foo'); // true\nawait keyv.clear(); // undefined\n```\n\n### Namespaces\n\nYou can namespace your Keyv instance to avoid key collisions and allow you to clear only a certain namespace while using the same database.\n\n```js\nconst users = new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379', { namespace: 'users' });\nconst cache = new Keyv('redis://user:pass@localhost:6379', { namespace: 'cache' });\n\nawait users.set('foo', 'users'); // true\nawait cache.set('foo', 'cache'); // true\nawait users.get('foo'); // 'users'\nawait cache.get('foo'); // 'cache'\nawait users.clear(); // undefined\nawait users.get('foo'); // undefined\nawait cache.get('foo'); // 'cache'\n```\n\n### Custom Serializers\n\nKeyv uses [`json-buffer`](https://github.com/dominictarr/json-buffer) for data serialization to ensure consistency across different backends.\n\nYou can optionally provide your own serialization functions to support extra data types or to serialize to something other than JSON.\n\n```js\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ serialize: JSON.stringify, deserialize: JSON.parse });\n```\n\n**Warning:** Using custom serializers means you lose any guarantee of data consistency. You should do extensive testing with your serialisation functions and chosen storage engine.\n\n## Official Storage Adapters\n\nThe official storage adapters are covered by [over 150 integration tests](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/actions/workflows/tests.yaml) to guarantee consistent behaviour. They are lightweight, efficient wrappers over the DB clients making use of indexes and native TTLs where available.\n\nDatabase | Adapter | Native TTL\n---|---|---\nRedis | [@keyv/redis](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/redis) | Yes\nMongoDB | [@keyv/mongo](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/mongo) | Yes \nSQLite | [@keyv/sqlite](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/sqlite) | No \nPostgreSQL | [@keyv/postgres](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/postgres) | No \nMySQL | [@keyv/mysql](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/mysql) | No \nEtcd | [@keyv/etcd](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/etcd) | Yes\nMemcache | [@keyv/memcache](https://github.com/jaredwray/keyv/tree/master/packages/memcache) | Yes\n\n## Third-party Storage Adapters\n\nYou can also use third-party storage adapters or build your own. Keyv will wrap these storage adapters in TTL functionality and handle complex types internally.\n\n```js\nconst Keyv = require('keyv');\nconst myAdapter = require('./my-storage-adapter');\n\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ store: myAdapter });\n```\n\nAny store that follows the [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) api will work.\n\n```js\nnew Keyv({ store: new Map() });\n```\n\nFor example, [`quick-lru`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-lru) is a completely unrelated module that implements the Map API.\n\n```js\nconst Keyv = require('keyv');\nconst QuickLRU = require('quick-lru');\n\nconst lru = new QuickLRU({ maxSize: 1000 });\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ store: lru });\n```\n\nThe following are third-party storage adapters compatible with Keyv:\n\n- [quick-lru](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-lru) - Simple \"Least Recently Used\" (LRU) cache\n- [keyv-file](https://github.com/zaaack/keyv-file) - File system storage adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-dynamodb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-dynamodb) - DynamoDB storage adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-lru](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-lru) - LRU storage adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-null](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keyv-null) - Null storage adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-firestore ](https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/keyv-firestore) – Firebase Cloud Firestore adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-mssql](https://github.com/pmorgan3/keyv-mssql) - Microsoft Sql Server adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-azuretable](https://github.com/howlowck/keyv-azuretable) - Azure Table Storage/API adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-arango](https://github.com/TimMikeladze/keyv-arango) - ArangoDB storage adapter for Keyv\n- [keyv-momento](https://github.com/momentohq/node-keyv-adaptor/) - Momento storage adapter for Keyv\n\n## Add Cache Support to your Module\n\nKeyv is designed to be easily embedded into other modules to add cache support. The recommended pattern is to expose a `cache` option in your modules options which is passed through to Keyv. Caching will work in memory by default and users have the option to also install a Keyv storage adapter and pass in a connection string, or any other storage that implements the `Map` API.\n\nYou should also set a namespace for your module so you can safely call `.clear()` without clearing unrelated app data.\n\nInside your module:\n\n```js\nclass AwesomeModule {\n\tconstructor(opts) {\n\t\tthis.cache = new Keyv({\n\t\t\turi: typeof opts.cache === 'string' && opts.cache,\n\t\t\tstore: typeof opts.cache !== 'string' && opts.cache,\n\t\t\tnamespace: 'awesome-module'\n\t\t});\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nNow it can be consumed like this:\n\n```js\nconst AwesomeModule = require('awesome-module');\n\n// Caches stuff in memory by default\nconst awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule();\n\n// After npm install --save keyv-redis\nconst awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule({ cache: 'redis://localhost' });\n\n// Some third-party module that implements the Map API\nconst awesomeModule = new AwesomeModule({ cache: some3rdPartyStore });\n```\n\n## Compression\n\nKeyv supports `gzip` and `brotli` compression. To enable compression, pass the `compress` option to the constructor.\n\n```js\nconst KeyvGzip = require('@keyv/compress-gzip');\nconst Keyv = require('keyv');\n\nconst keyvGzip = new KeyvGzip();\nconst keyv = new Keyv({ compression: KeyvGzip });\n```\n\nYou can also pass a custom compression function to the `compression` option. Following the pattern of the official compression adapters.\n\n### Want to build your own? \n\nGreat! Keyv is designed to be easily extended. You can build your own compression adapter by following the pattern of the official compression adapters based on this interface:\n\n```typescript\ninterface CompressionAdapter {\n\tasync compress(value: any, options?: any);\n\tasync decompress(value: any, options?: any);\n\tasync serialize(value: any);\n\tasync deserialize(value: any);\n}\n```\n\nIn addition to the interface, you can test it with our compression test suite using @keyv/test-suite:\n\n```js\nconst {keyvCompresstionTests} = require('@keyv/test-suite');\nconst KeyvGzip = require('@keyv/compress-gzip');\n\nkeyvCompresstionTests(test, new KeyvGzip());\n```\n\n## API\n\n### new Keyv([uri], [options])\n\nReturns a new Keyv instance.\n\nThe Keyv instance is also an `EventEmitter` that will emit an `'error'` event if the storage adapter connection fails.\n\n### uri\n\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: `undefined`\n\nThe connection string URI.\n\nMerged into the options object as options.uri.\n\n### options\n\nType: `Object`\n\nThe options object is also passed through to the storage adapter. Check your storage adapter docs for any extra options.\n\n#### options.namespace\n\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: `'keyv'`\n\nNamespace for the current instance.\n\n#### options.ttl\n\nType: `Number`<br>\nDefault: `undefined`\n\nDefault TTL. Can be overridden by specififying a TTL on `.set()`.\n\n#### options.compression\n\nType: `@keyv/compress-<compression_package_name>`<br>\nDefault: `undefined`\n\nCompression package to use. See [Compression](#compression) for more details.\n\n#### options.serialize\n\nType: `Function`<br>\nDefault: `JSONB.stringify`\n\nA custom serialization function.\n\n#### options.deserialize\n\nType: `Function`<br>\nDefault: `JSONB.parse`\n\nA custom deserialization function.\n\n#### options.store\n\nType: `Storage adapter instance`<br>\nDefault: `new Map()`\n\nThe storage adapter instance to be used by Keyv.\n\n#### options.adapter\n\nType: `String`<br>\nDefault: `undefined`\n\nSpecify an adapter to use. e.g `'redis'` or `'mongodb'`.\n\n### Instance\n\nKeys must always be strings. Values can be of any type.\n\n#### .set(key, value, [ttl])\n\nSet a value.\n\nBy default keys are persistent. You can set an expiry TTL in milliseconds.\n\nReturns a promise which resolves to `true`.\n\n#### .get(key, [options])\n\nReturns a promise which resolves to the retrieved value.\n\n##### options.raw\n\nType: `Boolean`<br>\nDefault: `false`\n\nIf set to true the raw DB object Keyv stores internally will be returned instead of just the value.\n\nThis contains the TTL timestamp.\n\n#### .delete(key)\n\nDeletes an entry.\n\nReturns a promise which resolves to `true` if the key existed, `false` if not.\n\n#### .clear()\n\nDelete all entries in the current namespace.\n\nReturns a promise which is resolved when the entries have been cleared.\n\n#### .iterator()\n\nIterate over all entries of the current namespace.\n\nReturns a iterable that can be iterated by for-of loops. For example:\n\n```js\n// please note that the \"await\" keyword should be used here\nfor await (const [key, value] of this.keyv.iterator()) {\n  console.log(key, value);\n};\n```\n\n# How to Contribute\n\nIn this section of the documentation we will cover:\n\n1) How to set up this repository locally\n2) How to get started with running commands\n3) How to contribute changes using Pull Requests\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThis package requires the following dependencies to run:\n\n1) [Yarn V1](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)\n3) [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)\n\n## Setting up your workspace\n\nTo contribute to this repository, start by setting up this project locally:\n\n1) Fork this repository into your Git account\n2) Clone the forked repository to your local directory using `git clone`\n3) Install any of the above missing dependencies\n\n## Launching the project\n\nOnce the project is installed locally, you are ready to start up its services:\n\n1) Ensure that your Docker service is running.\n2) From the root directory of your project, run the `yarn` command in the command prompt to install yarn.\n3) Run the `yarn bootstrap` command to  install any necessary dependencies.\n4) Run `yarn test:services:start` to start up this project's Docker container. The container will launch all services within your workspace.\n\n## Available Commands\n\nOnce the project is running, you can execute a variety of commands. The root workspace and each subpackage contain a `package.json` file with a  `scripts` field listing all the commands that can be executed from that directory. This project also supports native `yarn`, and `docker` commands.\n\nHere, we'll cover the primary commands that can be executed from the root directory. Unless otherwise noted, these commands can also be executed from a subpackage. If executed from a subpackage, they will only affect that subpackage, rather than the entire workspace.\n\n### `yarn`\n\nThe `yarn` command installs yarn in the workspace.\n\n### `yarn bootstrap`\n\nThe `yarn bootstrap` command installs all dependencies in the workspace.\n\n### `yarn test:services:start`\n\nThe `yarn test:services:start` command starts up the project's Docker container, launching all services in the workspace. This command must be executed from the root directory.\n\n### `yarn test:services:stop`\n\nThe `yarn test:services:stop` command brings down the project's Docker container, halting all services. This command must be executed from the root directory.\n\n### `yarn test`\n\nThe `yarn test` command runs all tests in the workspace.\n\n### `yarn clean`\n\nThe `yarn clean` command removes yarn and all dependencies installed by yarn. After executing this command, you must repeat the steps in *Setting up your workspace* to rebuild your workspace.\n\n## Contributing Changes\n\nNow that you've set up your workspace, you're ready to contribute changes to the `keyv` repository.\n\n1) Make any changes that you would like to contribute in your local workspace.\n2) After making these changes, ensure that the project's tests still pass by executing the `yarn test` command in the root directory.\n3) Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.\n4) Navigate to the original `keyv` repository and go the *Pull Requests* tab.\n5) Click the *New pull request* button, and open a pull request for the branch in your repository that contains your changes.\n6) Once your pull request is created, ensure that all checks have passed and that your branch has no conflicts with the base branch. If there are any issues, resolve these changes in your local repository, and then commit and push them to git.\n7) Similarly, respond to any reviewer comments or requests for changes by making edits to your local repository and pushing them to Git.\n8) Once the pull request has been reviewed, those with write access to the branch will be able to merge your changes into the `keyv` repository.\n\nIf you need more information on the steps to create a pull request, you can find a detailed walkthrough in the [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\n\n## License\n\nMIT © Jared Wray",

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS",

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Import the `TimeagoModule`:\n\nOnce installed you need to import the main module into your application module by calling TimeagoModule.forRoot().\n\nMake sure you only call this method in the root module of your application, most of the time called `AppModule`.\nThis method allows you to configure the `TimeagoModule` by specifying a formatter, clock and/or an intl service. You should end up with code similar to this:\n\n```ts\nimport { BrowserModule } from \"@angular/platform-browser\";\nimport { NgModule } from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { TimeagoModule } from \"ngx-timeago\";\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [BrowserModule, TimeagoModule.forRoot()],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}\n```\n\n##### SharedModule\n\nIf you use a [`SharedModule`](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/ngmodule.html#!#shared-modules) that you import in multiple other feature modules,\nyou can export the `TimeagoModule` to make sure you don't have to import it in every module.\n\n```ts\n@NgModule({\n  exports: [CommonModule, TimeagoModule],\n})\nexport class SharedModule {}\n```\n\n##### Lazy loaded modules\n\nWhen you lazy load a module, you should use the `forChild` static method to import the `TimeagoModule`.\n\nSince lazy loaded modules use a different injector from the rest of your application, you can configure them separately with a different formatter/clock/intl service.\n\n```ts\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    TimeagoModule.forChild({\n      formatter: { provide: TimeagoFormatter, useClass: CustomFormatter },\n      clock: { provide: TimeagoClock, useClass: CustomClock },\n      intl: { provide: TimeagoIntl, useClass: CustomIntl },\n    }),\n  ],\n})\nexport class LazyLoadedModule {}\n```\n\n##### I18n\n\nBy default, there is no intl service available, as the default formatter doesn't provide language support.\nYou should provide one, if you end up with a formatter that needs it (either TimeagoCustomFormatter which is provided by the lib or your own). The purpose of the intl service is to contain all the necessary i18n strings used by your formatter.\n\n```ts\nimport { NgModule } from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { BrowserModule } from \"@angular/platform-browser\";\nimport { Timeago, TimeagoIntl, TimeagoFormatter, TimeagoCustomFormatter } from \"ngx-timeago\";\nimport { AppComponent } from \"./app\";\n\nexport class MyIntl extends TimeagoIntl {\n  // do extra stuff here...\n}\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    TimeagoModule.forRoot({\n      intl: { provide: TimeagoIntl, useClass: MyIntl },\n      formatter: { provide: TimeagoFormatter, useClass: TimeagoCustomFormatter },\n    }),\n  ],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}\n```\n\nThere is support for a large number of languages out of the box. This support is based on the string objects taken from `jquery-timeago`.\n\nTo use any of the languages provided, you will have to import the language strings and feed them to the intl service.\n\n```ts\nimport { Component } from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { TimeagoIntl } from \"ngx-timeago\";\nimport { strings as englishStrings } from \"ngx-timeago/language-strings/en\";\n\n@Component({\n  selector: \"app\",\n  template: ` <div timeago [date]=\"1553683912689\"></div> `,\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  constructor(intl: TimeagoIntl) {\n    intl.strings = englishStrings;\n    intl.changes.next();\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can also customize the language strings or provide your own.\n\n#### 2. Use the pipe or the directive:\n\nThis is how you do it with the **pipe**:\n\n```html\n<div>{{1553683912689 | timeago:live}}</div>\n```\n\nAnd in your component define live (`true` by default).\n\nThis is how you use the **directive**:\n\n```html\n<div timeago [date]=\"1553683912689\" [live]=\"live\"></div>\n```\n\n## API\n\n#### Write your own formatter\n\nIf you want to write your own formatter, you need to create a class that implements `TimeagoFormatter`. The only required method is `format` that must return the final `string`.\n\n[Example](lib/src/timeago.formatter.ts)\n\nOnce you've defined your formatter, you can provide it in your configuration.\n\n```ts\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    TimeagoModule.forRoot({\n      formatter: { provide: TimeagoFormatter, useClass: CustomFormatter },\n    }),\n  ],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}\n```\n\n#### Write your own clock\n\nThe only required method to build your own clock, is `tick` that must return an `Observable<any>`. Whenever this observable emits, the timestamp will be updated, using your formatter (and intl, if available).\n\n```ts\nimport { TimeagoClock } from \"ngx-timeago\";\nimport { Observable, interval } from \"rxjs\";\n\n// ticks every 2s\nexport class MyClock extends TimeagoClock {\n  tick(then: number): Observable<number> {\n    return interval(2000);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSetup the clock in your module import by adding it to the `forRoot` (or `forChild`) configuration.\n\n```ts\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    TimeagoModule.forRoot({\n      clock: { provide: TimeagoClock, useClass: MyClock },\n    }),\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}\n```\n\n## Contribute\n\n`ngx-timeago` is packaged with [ng-packagr](https://github.com/dherges/ng-packagr) and then imported into an Angular CLI app.\nTo run the demo, do the following steps:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install\n$ npm run build:lib\n$ npm start\n```\n\n---\n\nMIT © [Vasilis Diakomanolis](https://github.com/ihym)",

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n          NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.",

This includes files in which no replacements were made.\n\nEach result contains the following values:\n\n- `file`: The path to the file that was processed\n- `hasChanged`: Flag to indicate if the file was changed or not\n\n```js\nconst results = replace.sync({\n  files: 'path/to/files/*.html',\n  from: /foo/g,\n  to: 'bar',\n});\n\nconsole.log(results);\n\n// [\n//   {\n//     file: 'path/to/files/file1.html',\n//     hasChanged: true,\n//   },\n//   {\n//     file: 'path/to/files/file2.html',\n//     hasChanged: true,\n//   },\n//   {\n//     file: 'path/to/files/file3.html',\n//     hasChanged: false,\n//   },\n// ]\n\n```\n\nTo get an array of changed files, simply map the results as follows:\n\n```js\nconst changedFiles = results\n  .filter(result => result.hasChanged)\n  .map(result => result.file);\n```\n\n### Counting matches and replacements\nBy setting the `countMatches` configuration flag to `true`, the number of matches and replacements per file will be counted and present in the results array.\n\n- `numMatches`: Indicates the number of times a match was found in the file\n- `numReplacements`: Indicates the number of times a replacement was made in the file\n\nNote that the number of matches can be higher than the number of replacements if a match and replacement are the same string.\n\n```js\nconst results = replace.sync({\n  files: 'path/to/files/*.html',\n  from: /foo/g,\n  to: 'bar',\n  countMatches: true,\n});\n\nconsole.log(results);\n\n// [\n//   {\n//     file: 'path/to/files/file1.html',\n//     hasChanged: true,\n//     numMatches: 3,\n//     numReplacements: 3,\n//   },\n//   {\n//     file: 'path/to/files/file2.html',\n//     hasChanged: true,\n//     numMatches: 1,\n//     numReplacements: 1,\n//   },\n//   {\n//     file: 'path/to/files/file3.html',\n//     hasChanged: false,\n//     numMatches: 0,\n//     numReplacements: 0,\n//   },\n// ]\n```\n\n### Custom processor\n\nFor advanced usage where complex processing is needed it's possible to use a callback that will receive content as an argument and should return it processed.\n\n```js\nconst results = replace.sync({\n  files: 'path/to/files/*.html',\n  processor: (input) => input.replace(/foo/g, 'bar'),\n});\n```\n\n### Array of custom processors\n\nPassing processor function also supports passing an array of functions that will be executed sequentially\n\n```js\nfunction someProcessingA(input) {\n  const chapters = input.split('###')\n  chapters[1] = chapters[1].replace(/foo/g, 'bar')\n  return chapters.join('###')\n}\n\nfunction someProcessingB(input) {\n  return input.replace(/foo/g, 'bar')\n}\n\nconst results = replace.sync({\n  files: 'path/to/files/*.html',\n  processor: [someProcessingA, someProcessingB],\n});\n```\n\n## Advanced usage\n\n### Replace a single file or glob\n```js\nconst options = {\n  files: 'path/to/file',\n};\n```\n\n### Replace multiple files or globs\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  files: [\n    'path/to/file',\n    'path/to/other/file',\n    'path/to/files/*.html',\n    'another/**/*.path',\n  ],\n};\n```\n\n### Replace first occurrence only\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  from: 'foo',\n  to: 'bar',\n};\n```\n\n### Replace all occurrences\nPlease note that the value specified in the `from` parameter is passed straight to the native [String replace method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace). As such, if you pass a string as the `from` parameter, it will _only replace the first occurrence_.\n\nTo replace multiple occurrences at once, you must use a regular expression for the `from` parameter with the global flag enabled, e.g. `/foo/g`.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  from: /foo/g,\n  to: 'bar',\n};\n```\n\n### Multiple values with the same replacement\n\nThese will be replaced sequentially.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  from: [/foo/g, /baz/g],\n  to: 'bar',\n};\n```\n\n### Multiple values with different replacements\n\nThese will be replaced sequentially.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  from: [/foo/g, /baz/g],\n  to: ['bar', 'bax'],\n};\n```\n\n### Custom regular expressions\n\nUse the [RegExp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp) constructor to create any regular expression.\n\n```js\nconst str = 'foo';\nconst regex = new RegExp('^' + str + 'bar', 'i');\nconst options = {\n  from: regex,\n  to: 'bar',\n};\n```\n\n### Using callbacks for `from`\nYou can also specify a callback that returns a string or a regular expression. The callback receives the name of the file in which the replacement is being performed, thereby allowing the user to tailor the search string. The following example uses a callback to produce a search string dependent on the filename:\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  files: 'path/to/file',\n  from: (file) => new RegExp(file, 'g'),\n  to: 'bar',\n};\n```\n\n### Using callbacks for `to`\nAs the `to` parameter is passed to the native [String replace method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace), you can also specify a callback. The following example uses a callback to convert matching strings to lowercase:\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  files: 'path/to/file',\n  from: /SomePattern[A-Za-z-]+/g,\n  to: (match) => match.toLowerCase(),\n};\n```\n\nThis callback provides for an extra argument above the String replace method, which is the name of the file in which the replacement is being performed. The following example replaces the matched string with the filename:\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  files: 'path/to/file',\n  from: /SomePattern[A-Za-z-]+/g,\n  to: (...args) => args.pop(),\n};\n```\n\n### Ignore a single file or glob\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  ignore: 'path/to/ignored/file',\n};\n```\n\n### Ignore multiple files or globs\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  ignore: [\n    'path/to/ignored/file',\n    'path/to/other/ignored_file',\n    'path/to/ignored_files/*.html',\n    'another/**/*.ignore',\n  ],\n};\n```\n\nPlease note that there is an [open issue with Glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/issues/309) that causes ignored patterns to be ignored when using a `./` prefix in your files glob. To work around this, simply remove the prefix, e.g. use `**/*` instead of `./**/*`.\n\n### Allow empty/invalid paths\nIf set to true, empty or invalid paths will fail silently and no error will be thrown. For asynchronous replacement only. Defaults to `false`.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  allowEmptyPaths: true,\n};\n```\n\n### Disable globs\nYou can disable globs if needed using this flag. Use this when you run into issues with file paths like files like `//SERVER/share/file.txt`. Defaults to `false`.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  disableGlobs: true,\n};\n```\n\n### Specify glob configuration\nSpecify configuration passed to the [glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) call:\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  glob: {\n    //Glob settings here\n    dot: true, //E.g. to include file names starting with a dot\n  },\n};\n```\n\nPlease note that the setting `nodir` will always be passed as `false`.\n\n### Making replacements on network drives\nTo make replacements in files on network drives, you may need to specify the UNC path as the `cwd` config option. This will then be passed to glob and prefixed to your paths accordingly. See [#56](https://github.com/adamreisnz/replace-in-file/issues/56) for more details.\n\n### Specify character encoding\nUse a different character encoding for reading/writing files. Defaults to `utf-8`.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  encoding: 'utf8',\n};\n```\n\n### Dry run\nTo do a dry run without actually making replacements, for testing purposes. Defaults to `false`.\n\n```js\nconst options = {\n  dry: true,\n};\n```\n\n## CLI usage\n\n```sh\nreplace-in-file from to some/file.js,some/**/glob.js\n  [--configFile=replace-config.js]\n  [--ignore=ignore/files.js,ignore/**/glob.js]\n  [--encoding=utf-8]\n  [--disableGlobs]\n  [--isRegex]\n  [--verbose]\n  [--quiet]\n  [--dry]\n```\n\nMultiple files or globs can be replaced by providing a comma separated list.\n\nThe flags `--disableGlobs`, `--ignore` and `--encoding` are supported in the CLI.\n\nThe setting `allowEmptyPaths` is not supported in the CLI as the replacement is\nsynchronous, and this setting is only relevant for asynchronous replacement.\n\nTo list the changed files, use the `--verbose` flag. Success output can be suppressed by using the `--quiet` flag.\n\nTo do a dry run without making any actual changes, use `--dry`.\n\nA regular expression may be used for the `from` parameter by specifying the `--isRegex` flag.\n\nThe `from` and `to` parameters, as well as the files list, can be omitted if you provide this\ninformation in a configuration file. You can provide a path to a configuration file\n(either Javascript or JSON) with the `--configFile` flag. This path will be resolved using\nNode’s built in `path.resolve()`, so you can pass in an absolute or relative path.\n\n## A note on using globs with the CLI\nWhen using the CLI, the glob pattern is handled by the operating system. But if you specify the glob pattern in the configuration file, the package will use the glob module from the Node modules, and this can lead to different behaviour despite using the same pattern.\n\nFor example, the following will only look at top level files:\n\n```js\n//config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  from: /cat/g,\n  to: 'dog',\n};\n```\n\n```sh\nreplace-in-file **  --configFile=config.js\n```\n\nHowever, this example is recursive:\n\n```js\n//config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  files: '**',\n  from: /cat/g,\n  to: 'dog',\n};\n```\n\n```sh\nreplace-in-file --configFile=config.js\n```\n\nIf you want to do a recursive file search as an argument you must use:\n\n```sh\nreplace-in-file $(ls l {,**/}*)  --configFile=config.js\n```\n\n## Version information\nFrom version 3.0.0 onwards, replace in file requires Node 6 or higher. If you need support for Node 4 or 5, please use version 2.x.x.\n\nFrom version 5.0.0 onwards, replace in file requires Node 8 or higher. If you need support for Node 6, please use version 4.x.x.\n\nSee the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for more information.\n\n## License\n(MIT License)\n\nCopyright 2015-2023, Adam Reis, Co-founder at [Hello Club](https://helloclub.com/?source=npm) and [Frello](https://getfrello.com/?source=npm)",

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Also, `spdy` is compatible with Express.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Examples\n\nServer:\n```javascript\nvar spdy = require('spdy'),\n    fs = require('fs');\n\nvar options = {\n  // Private key\n  key: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-key.pem'),\n\n  // Fullchain file or cert file (prefer the former)\n  cert: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-fullchain.pem'),\n\n  // **optional** SPDY-specific options\n  spdy: {\n    protocols: [ 'h2', 'spdy/3.1', ..., 'http/1.1' ],\n    plain: false,\n\n    // **optional**\n    // Parse first incoming X_FORWARDED_FOR frame and put it to the\n    // headers of every request.\n    // NOTE: Use with care! This should not be used without some proxy that\n    // will *always* send X_FORWARDED_FOR\n    'x-forwarded-for': true,\n\n    connection: {\n      windowSize: 1024 * 1024, // Server's window size\n\n      // **optional** if true - server will send 3.1 frames on 3.0 *plain* spdy\n      autoSpdy31: false\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nvar server = spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {\n  res.writeHead(200);\n  res.end('hello world!');\n});\n\nserver.listen(3000);\n```\n\nClient:\n```javascript\nvar spdy = require('spdy');\nvar https = require('https');\n\nvar agent = spdy.createAgent({\n  host: 'www.google.com',\n  port: 443,\n\n  // Optional SPDY options\n  spdy: {\n    plain: false,\n    ssl: true,\n\n    // **optional** send X_FORWARDED_FOR\n    'x-forwarded-for': '127.0.0.1'\n  }\n});\n\nhttps.get({\n  host: 'www.google.com',\n  agent: agent\n}, function(response) {\n  console.log('yikes');\n  // Here it goes like with any other node.js HTTP request\n  // ...\n  // And once we're done - we may close TCP connection to server\n  // NOTE: All non-closed requests will die!\n  agent.close();\n}).end();\n```\n\nPlease note that if you use a custom agent, by default all connection-level\nerrors will result in an uncaught exception. To handle these errors subscribe\nto the `error` event and re-emit the captured error:\n\n```javascript\nvar agent = spdy.createAgent({\n  host: 'www.google.com',\n  port: 443\n}).once('error', function (err) {\n  this.emit(err);\n});\n```\n\n#### Push streams\n\nIt is possible to initiate [PUSH_PROMISE][5] to send content to clients _before_\nthe client requests it.\n\n```javascript\nspdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {\n  var stream = res.push('/main.js', {\n    status: 200, // optional\n    method: 'GET', // optional\n    request: {\n      accept: '*/*'\n    },\n    response: {\n      'content-type': 'application/javascript'\n    }\n  });\n  stream.on('error', function() {\n  });\n  stream.end('alert(\"hello from push stream!\");');\n\n  res.end('<script src=\"/main.js\"></script>');\n}).listen(3000);\n```\n\n[PUSH_PROMISE][5] may be sent using the `push()` method on the current response\nobject.  The signature of the `push()` method is:\n\n`.push('/some/relative/url', { request: {...}, response: {...} }, callback)`\n\nSecond argument contains headers for both PUSH_PROMISE and emulated response.\n`callback` will receive two arguments: `err` (if any error is happened) and a\n[Duplex][4] stream as the second argument.\n\nClient usage:\n```javascript\nvar agent = spdy.createAgent({ /* ... */ });\nvar req = http.get({\n  host: 'www.google.com',\n  agent: agent\n}, function(response) {\n});\nreq.on('push', function(stream) {\n  stream.on('error', function(err) {\n    // Handle error\n  });\n  // Read data from stream\n});\n```\n\nNOTE: You're responsible for the `stream` object once given it in `.push()`\ncallback or `push` event. Hence ignoring `error` event on it will result in\nuncaught exception and crash your program.\n\n#### Trailing headers\n\nServer usage:\n```javascript\nfunction (req, res) {\n  // Send trailing headers to client\n  res.addTrailers({ header1: 'value1', header2: 'value2' });\n\n  // On client's trailing headers\n  req.on('trailers', function(headers) {\n    // ...\n  });\n}\n```\n\nClient usage:\n```javascript\nvar req = http.request({ agent: spdyAgent, /* ... */ }).function (res) {\n  // On server's trailing headers\n  res.on('trailers', function(headers) {\n    // ...\n  });\n});\nreq.write('stuff');\nreq.addTrailers({ /* ... */ });\nreq.end();\n```\n\n#### Options\n\nAll options supported by [tls][2] work with node-spdy.\n\nAdditional options may be passed via `spdy` sub-object:\n\n* `plain` - if defined, server will ignore NPN and ALPN data and choose whether\n  to use spdy or plain http by looking at first data packet.\n* `ssl` - if `false` and `options.plain` is `true`, `http.Server` will be used\n  as a `base` class for created server.\n* `maxChunk` - if set and non-falsy, limits number of bytes sent in one DATA\n  chunk. Setting it to non-zero value is recommended if you care about\n  interleaving of outgoing data from multiple different streams.\n  (defaults to 8192)\n* `protocols` - list of NPN/ALPN protocols to use (default is:\n  `['h2','spdy/3.1', 'spdy/3', 'spdy/2','http/1.1', 'http/1.0']`)\n* `protocol` - use specific protocol if no NPN/ALPN ex In addition,\n* `maxStreams` - set \"[maximum concurrent streams][3]\" protocol option\n\n### API\n\nAPI is compatible with `http` and `https` module, but you can use another\nfunction as base class for SPDYServer.\n\n```javascript\nspdy.createServer(\n  [base class constructor, i.e. https.Server],\n  { /* keys and options */ }, // <- the only one required argument\n  [request listener]\n).listen([port], [host], [callback]);\n```\n\nRequest listener will receive two arguments: `request` and `response`. They're\nboth instances of `http`'s `IncomingMessage` and `OutgoingMessage`. But three\ncustom properties are added to both of them: `isSpdy`, `spdyVersion`. `isSpdy`\nis `true` when the request was processed using HTTP2/SPDY protocols, it is\n`false` in case of HTTP/1.1 fallback. `spdyVersion` is either of: `2`, `3`,\n`3.1`, or `4` (for HTTP2).\n\n\n#### Contributors\n\n* [Fedor Indutny](https://github.com/indutny)\n* [Chris Strom](https://github.com/eee-c)\n* [François de Metz](https://github.com/francois2metz)\n* [Ilya Grigorik](https://github.com/igrigorik)\n* [Roberto Peon](https://github.com/grmocg)\n* [Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa](https://github.com/tatsuhiro-t)\n* [Jesse Cravens](https://github.com/jessecravens)\n\n#### LICENSE\n\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2015.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

        "licenseText": "# `typed-assert`\n\n`typed-assert` is a typesafe assertion library implementing the [TS 3.7 Assertion Functions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html#assertion-functions) API, without external dependencies.\n\nSee the [documentation](API.md).\n\n### Consider using [`zod`](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)\n\nWhile this library does a fine job for most simple use cases, please consider using [`zod`](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) if you need more complex assertions.\n\n### Install\n\n```npm install typed-assert```\n\nor\n\n```yarn add typed-assert```\n\n### Why is it useful?\n\n`typed-assert` promotes using `unknown` instead of `any` for \"untrusted\" values, e.g. user input, while still benefiting from incremental typing.\n\nFor example, `JSON.stringify` returns `any`, which is not typesafe. With `typed-assert`, we can instead treat the result as `unknown` and gradually check the contents at runtime and still get correct type inference:\n\n```ts\nimport * as t from \"typed-assert\";\n\nconst parseConfigFile = (file: string): { readonly a: string, readonly b: number } => {\n  const contents = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(file, { encoding: 'utf8'})) as unknown;\n  // contents is \"unknown\" instead of any, because we don't trust the input yet\n  t.isRecord(contents);\n  // contents is \"Record<string, unknown>\"\n  t.isString(contents.a);\n  // contents.a is \"string\"\n  t.isNumber(contents.b):\n  // contents.b is \"number\";\n  return {\n    a: contents.a,\n    b: contents.b,\n  }; // correctly typed\n}\n```\n\n### How is it different from chai, jest.expect, etc?\n\n`typed-assert` is both a compile-time and runtime assert library. It leverages the `assertion function` feature of TypeScript to help the typechecker narrow the inferred types. In many cases, this significantly reduces the need to use `any`, and promotes using `unknown` instead.\n\nFor example:\n\n```ts\nconst u: unknown = {\n  a: \"value\",\n  b: 12,\n};\n\nchai.assert.typeOf(u, \"object\");\n// u is still \"unknown\"\nchai.assert.isNotNull(u);\n// u is still \"unknown\"\nchai.assert.typeof(u.a, \"string\");\n// TS Error (ts2571): u is \"unknown\"\n\nimport * as t from \"typed-assert\";\n\nt.isRecord(u);\n// u is Record<string, unknown>\nt.isString(u.a);\n// u.a is string\nt.isNumber(u.b);\n// u.b is number\n\nconst v: { a: string; b: number } = u;\n// no need to us `as ...`\n```\n\n### Usage\n\n`typed-assert` comes with a set of common assertions, as well as assertion combinators and utilities.\n\nSee [the documentation](./API.md) for a full reference.\n\n```ts\nimport * as t from \"typed-assert\";\n\n// Base asserts\nt.isExactly(\"a\", \"a\");\nt.isNotUndefined(null);\nt.isNotNull(undefined);\n\n// Asserts combinators\nt.isOneOf(\"b\", [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]);\nt.isArrayOf([2, 3, 4], t.isNumber);\n\n// Custom composite checks\ninterface ICustomType {\n  readonly a: {\n    readonly b: \"c\";\n    readonly d: string;\n  };\n  readonly f?: number;\n}\n\nfunction assertCustomType(input: unknown): asserts input is ICustomType {\n  t.isRecordWithKeys(input, [\"a\", \"f\"]);\n  t.isRecordWithKeys(input.a, [\"b\", \"d\"]);\n  t.isExactly(input.a.b, \"c\");\n  t.isString(input.a.d);\n  t.isOption(input.f, t.isNumber);\n}\n\nconst v = {\n  a: {\n    b: \"c\",\n    d: \"\",\n  },\n};\nassertCustomType(v);\n```\n\nThis library also comes with a combinator to transform an assertion functions into a [type guard function](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#user-defined-type-guards):\n```ts\nconst checkNumber = t.check(t.isNumber);\ncheckNumber(1) === true;\ncheckNumber(\"\") === false;\n```\n\nIt is especially convenient when combined with functional operations such as `Array#filter`:\n```ts\nconst t = [\"a\", 3, \"c\", 4, null, 2]\n  .filter(t.check(t.isNumber))\n  .map(x => x % 2 === 0 ? x : null) // x: number\n  .filter(t.check(t.isNotNull));\n// t: number[] = [4, 2]\n```\n\nTo encourage using asserts when dealing with untrusted JSON input, the following function is also exported:\n```ts\nexport const safeJsonParse = (json: string): unknown =>\n  JSON.parse(json) as unknown;\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\nThis library is designed to work in the browser as well as in Node without external dependencies, and by default does not use the `assert` module from the Node stdlib, so it ships with a very basic `assert` implementation:\n```ts\nexport type WeakAssert = (input: unknown, message?: string) => void;\n\nexport const defaultAssert: WeakAssert = (condition, message) => {\n  if (!condition) {\n    throw new TypeError(message);\n  }\n};\n\n```\n\nIt is however possible to configure the library to use a provided base `assert` function, such as the native `assert` module:\n```ts\nimport * as t from \"typed-assert\";\nimport nodeAssert from \"assert\";\n\nt.setBaseAssert(nodeAssert);\n```\n\n### Caveats\n\nDue to limitations in the typechecker, there are syntactic restrictions in how to define and use type assertion functions. For example, you can not dynamically define an assertion function, even if it looks like a static definition.\n\nThus the following code won't compile:\n```ts\nfunction createIsExactly<T>(value: T): (input: unknown) => asserts input is T {\n  return function isExactly(input: unknown): asserts input is T {\n    t.isExactly(input, value);\n  };\n}\n// No problem so far\n\ncreateIsExactly(\"a\")(null);\n// Won't compile:\n// Assertions require the call target to be an\n//  identifier or qualified name.ts(2776)\n```\n\nFor similar reasons, it is not possible to use type-inferred arrow functions to define assertion functions:\n```ts\nconst isExactlyNull = (input: unknown): asserts input is null => assert(input === value);\n// No problem so far\n\nisExactlyNull(\"a\", null):\n// Won't compile:\n// Assertions require the call target to be an\n//  identifier or qualified name.ts(2776)\n```\n\nIt is however possible to use arrow function with explicit typing of the left-hand operand:\n```ts\nconst isExactlyNull: (input: unknown) => asserts input is null = (input) =>\n  assert(input === null);\n\nisExactlyNull(\"a\");\n// No problem\n```\n\nTo simplify the implementation,\n\nTo simplify this pattern, this library also exports the `Assert<Input, Output>` type as defined below:\n```ts\nexport type Assert<T> = (\n  input: unknown,\n  message?: string,\n) => asserts input is T;\n\nconst isExactlyNull: Assert<null> = (input) => assert(input === null);\n\nisExactlyNull(\"a\");\n// No problem\n```\n\nFor convenience, this library also exports the following types, used internally:\n\n```ts\nexport type WeakAssert = (input: unknown, message?: string) => void;\n\nexport type SubType<Input, Output> = Output extends Input ? Output : never;\n\nexport type Assert<Input = unknown, Output = Input> = (\n  input: Input,\n  message?: string,\n) => asserts input is SubType<Input, Output>;\n\nexport type Check<Input = unknown, Output = Input> = (\n  input: Input,\n) => input is SubType<Input, Output>;\n```\n\nThis way we can write:\n```ts\nconst isExactlyNull: Assert<unknown, null> = (input) =>\n  assert(input === null);\n\nisExactlyNull(\"a\");\n```",
