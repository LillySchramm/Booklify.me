## Description

Amazon started as a bookstore and has since grown into a massive online retailer.
It still has a huge selection of books, and is a great source for accurate metadata.

Problem is that that Amazon restricts access to their API, and you need to be a registered developer to use it.
And even then, you have to pay buissness fees to use it. This makes it hard to use Amazon as a source for metadata.
Bookly has a workaround for this, as it can scrape Amazon's website for metadata.

Amazon is very good at detecting and blocking bots and scrapers, so it is not not viable to directly scrape Amazon's website.

Instead Bookly uses a service called [Geonode](https://geonode.com/) to scrape Amazon's website.
Geonode is a service that provides a scraping API which can be used to scrape websites
like Amazon by using their residential proxies.

This means that you can use Amazon as a source for metadata, but you will have to pay for the Geonode service.

Due to the way Geonode works, it may take a while to get the metadata for a book, as it has to go through the residential proxies.
This is why Amazon is marked as longrunning and will only be executed whenever the `doLongruning` task is executed.

## Configuration

After you have signed up for Geonode, you will get an API key. You can add this key to the `config.json` file.
```json5
"geonode": {
    "username": "your-username",
    "password": "your-password",
}
```

Once you have added the key, Amazon will be used as a source for metadata whenever the `doLongrunning` task is executed.
