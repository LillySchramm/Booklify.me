# E-Mail Templates

Booklify uses Templates for sending e-mails to users. You can customize these templates to match your preferences.

## Customizing Templates

To customize the templates, you need to overwrite the corresponding `.html` files in the `assets/mail` directory of the backend.
All default templates can be found [here](https://gitlab.eps-dev.de/Lilly/booklify-ce/-/tree/v2/backend/assets/mail).

### Example in Docker

If you are using the Docker setup, you can copy the templates to the `assets/mail` directory of the backend by adding the following lines to your `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    volumes:
      - ./path/to/your/templates:/app/assets/mail
```

This will overwrite the default templates with your custom ones.

If you only want to customize a single template, you can also only overwrite this one:

```yaml
services:
  backend:
    volumes:
      - ./path/to/your/template.html:/app/assets/mail/template.html
```


## Variables

The templates use variables to insert dynamic content. All variables are enclosed in double curly braces eg. `{{variable}}`.

All templates have their own set of variables. The only exception is the `VERSION` variable, which is available in all templates.
