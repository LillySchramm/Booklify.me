## Description

ISBNdb is a web service for searching books using their ISBN.
It provides a simple API to access the data.
This source is used to get metadata and covers for books.

ISBNdb is a paid service, the cheapest plan is their `Academic` plan $7.50/month for 2000 daily requests.
They don't validate wheter you are eligable for the academic plan, so you can use it even if you are technically not eligible.
This should be more than enough for most users.

## Configuration

After you have signed up for ISBNdb, you will get an API key. You can then add it to your `config.json5` like this:

```json5
"isbndb": {
    "key": "<your key>"
}
```

Once you have added the key, ISBNdb will also be used to get metadata and covers for books.
