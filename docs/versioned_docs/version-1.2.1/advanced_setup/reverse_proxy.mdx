# Reverse Proxy

Booklify itself cannot serve its content over HTTPS.
To do so, you need to set up a reverse proxy.
This guide will show you how to set up a reverse proxy using Nginx.

:::warning
Serving Booklify over HTTP is not recommended as it will expose your data to potential attackers.
:::

## How to

Booklify does not require any special configuration to work behind a reverse proxy.
You can just set up the reverse proxy and point it to the Booklify frontend and backend.

Impotant things to note are:
- Booklify is not designed or tested to work with path-based routing.
- You should avoid caching the Booklify frontend as it may cause issues when updating the app.

## Nginx Example

Here is an example of how to set up a reverse proxy using Nginx:

```nginx
http {
    upstream backend {
        server localhost:3000;
    }

    upstream frontend {
        server localhost:3001;
    }

    server {
        listen      443 ssl;
        server_name api.example.com;

        ssl_certificate        /etc/ssl/certs/server.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key    /etc/ssl/certs/server.key;
        ssl_client_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/ca.crt;
        ssl_verify_client      optional;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;

        }

    server {
        listen      443 ssl;
        server_name example.com;

        ssl_certificate        /etc/ssl/certs/server.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key    /etc/ssl/certs/server.key;
        ssl_client_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/ca.crt;
        ssl_verify_client      optional;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://frontend;
        }
    }
}
```
