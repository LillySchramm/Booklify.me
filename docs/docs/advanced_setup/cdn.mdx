# CDN

By default, Booklify serves all dynamic assets like book covers directly from the backend.
This is fine for small to medium-sized instances, but is highly inefficient as the backend does not cache these assets.
This means that every time a user requests a book cover, the backend has to fetch the image from the S3 bucket and serve it to the user.
With large collections this can lead to a lot of unnecessary load on the backend.

One way to solve this is to serve these assets directly from the S3 bucket using [nginx-s3-gateway](https://github.com/nginxinc/nginx-s3-gateway).

A basic configuration for nginx-s3-gateway would look like this:

```yaml
    cdn:
        image: ghcr.io/nginxinc/nginx-s3-gateway/nginx-oss-s3-gateway:latest
        ports:
            - 8080:80
        env_file: config/cdn.env
```

And the `config/cdn.env` file would look like this:

```env
S3_BUCKET_NAME=booklify
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
S3_SERVER=s3.example.com
S3_SERVER_PORT=443
S3_SERVER_PROTO=https
S3_REGION=default
S3_STYLE=path
DEBUG=false
AWS_SIGS_VERSION=4
ALLOW_DIRECTORY_LIST=false
PROVIDE_INDEX_PAGE=false
APPEND_SLASH_FOR_POSSIBLE_DIRECTORY=true
PROXY_CACHE_MAX_SIZE=10g
PROXY_CACHE_INACTIVE=60m
PROXY_CACHE_VALID_OK=1h
PROXY_CACHE_VALID_NOTFOUND=1m
PROXY_CACHE_VALID_FORBIDDEN=30s
```

This configuration will serve all assets from the `booklify` S3 bucket on `http://localhost:8080`.

To use this in Booklify, you need to set the `cdn_url` setting.

```json5
{
    "cdn_url": "http://localhost:8080"
}
```

This will make the Booklify frontend request all assets from the CDN instead of the backend.
