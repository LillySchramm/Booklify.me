# Securing Booklify

Booklify is designed to be secure by default.
However, there are a few things you can do to harden your setup and make it even more secure.

## Use HTTPS

By default, Booklify runs on HTTP. This is fine for local development, but you should use HTTPS in production.
You can use a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache to terminate SSL and proxy requests to Booklify.

Read this guide to learn how to set up a reverse proxy for Booklify: [Reverse Proxy](/docs/advanced_setup/reverse_proxy)

## Use a strong value for `security.key`

The `security.key` setting is used to encrypt sensitive data in the database.
You should use a strong, random value for this setting.

You can generate a random value using the following command:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Then, set the value in your `config.json5` file:

```json5
{
  "security": {
    "key": "your-random-value"
  }
}
```

## Update the `cors` setting

The `cors` setting controls which domains are allowed to make requests to your Booklify server.
By default, it allows all domains to make requests by setting `*` as the value.

You should update this setting to only allow requests from trusted domains.

For example, if you have a website running on `https://example.com`, you can set the `cors` setting to only allow requests from that domain:

```json5
{
  "cors": "https://example.com"
}
```

## Secure your infrastructure

Every system is only as secure as its weakest link. Make sure to secure your infrastructure, including your server, database, and other services.
Typical security measures include:
- Keeping your server and software up to date
- Using strong, unique passwords
- Enabling a firewall
- Disabling unnecessary services
- Monitoring your server for suspicious activity
