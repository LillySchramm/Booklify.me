# Basic Setup

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you fullfill the [requirements](requirements).

Also you should decide which version of Booklify you want to use.
You can read more about the differences between the versions [here](versions).

## Download the demo deployment

Booklify comes with a demo deployment that you can use to get started.
Just download it by pulling the repository from [GitLab](https://gitlab.eps-dev.de/Lilly/booklify-ce).

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.eps-dev.de/Lilly/booklify-ce.git
```

Inside of the repository you will find a `demo` folder.
This folder contains a `docker-compose.yml` file that you can use to start the demo deployment.

Below you will find a detailed explanation of everything you need to know to get Booklify up and running in your environment.

## Setup and Configuration

### The `docker-compose.yml` file

This file contains everything you need to start booklify. It contains the following services:

#### `backend`
This service is the backend of Booklify. By default it is running on port `3030`.

By default it is configured to use the newest development version of Booklify.
If you want to use a specific version, you can change the `image` property to the version you want to use.
You can find the available versions [here](versions).

The configuration of the backend is done via a mounted `config.json` file. Read more about the configuration [here](#the-configconfigjson5-file).

It is also important that you specify the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.
If this variable is not set, the container will fail to run the database migrations and will exit with an error.
You can change the value of this variable to the database you want to use.
You can change the value of this variable in the `.env` file.

#### `frontend`

This service is the frontend of Booklify. By default it is running on port `8090`.

By default it is configured to use the newest development version of Booklify.
If you want to use a specific version, you can change the `image` property to the version you want to use.
You can find the available versions [here](versions).

It is also important that you specify the `BACKEND_URL` environment variable.
If this variable is not set, the frontend will not be able to connect to the backend.
You can change the value of this variable in the `.env` file.

#### `s3`

Booklify requires an S3 compatible storage to store certain files like the book covers.
By default the demo deployment uses the [S3Mock Server](https://github.com/adobe/S3Mock) to provide a simple S3 compatible storage.
It works out of the box and does not require any configuration, but note that it is not suitable for production use.

:::note info
For production use you should use a real S3 compatible storage like [MinIO](https://min.io/).
:::

#### `postgres`

Booklify requires a PostgreSQL database to store most of its data.
By default the demo deployment uses a PostgreSQL database.
It works out of the box and does not require any configuration.

:::warning
Make sure to at least change the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variable to a secure password.
:::


### The `.env` file

This file contains environment variables that are used by the `docker-compose.yml` file.
You can change the values of the variables to fit your environment.

### The `config/config.json5` file

This file contains the configuration of the backend. You can find information about all config options [here](config).
You only need to specify the options you want to change. The rest will be filled with default values.

Some important options are:

- `url`: The URL of the fontend.
- `api_url`: The URL of the backend.
- `db.url`: The URL of the database.
- `security.key`: The key which is used to encrypt sertain data. This key should be kept secret. Cannot be changed after the first start!

:::danger
Make sure to change the `security.key` option to a secure key. This key should be kept secret and should not be changed after the first start of the backend.
:::


## Start your deployment

After you have configured everything, you can start the deployment by running the following command in `demo` folder:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will start the deployment in the background.

You can now access the frontend by opening `http://localhost:8090` in your browser.

## Next Steps

Now that you have a running deployment, you read the [Advanced Setup](/) guide to learn how to customize your deployment.
