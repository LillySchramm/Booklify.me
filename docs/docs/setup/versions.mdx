# Versions

Before you start using Booklify, you should know that there are different versions of Booklify. They are split into two categories: **Developent** and **Stable**.

## Development

The development version is the version that is currently being developed. It is the version that contains the latest features and bug fixes. However, it may also contain bugs and other issues. Use the development version if you want to test the latest features and help us find bugs.


To use the development version, you can use the `v2` docker tag:
- `docker pull registry.cdev.nexus/booklify-ce/backend:v2`
- `docker pull registry.cdev.nexus/booklify-ce/frontend:v2`

## Stable

The stable version is the version that is considered stable and ready for production use. It contains all the features and bug fixes that have been tested and verified. Use the stable version if you want to use Booklify in a production environment.

All stable versions are tagged with the version number. For example, to use version `v1.2.1`, you can use the following docker tags:
- `docker pull registry.cdev.nexus/booklify-ce/backend:v1.2.1`
- `docker pull registry.cdev.nexus/booklify-ce/frontend:v1.2.1`
